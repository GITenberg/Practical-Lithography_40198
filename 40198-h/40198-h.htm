<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p style="text-indent:0">“Alois Senefelder never benefited much by his discovery
of the elementary principles of lithography, but none of those
to whom it has given profitable occupation will remember
without some feeling the patient and persistent efforts of the
struggling actor and dramatist who, only after the greatest
sacrifices and hardships, laid the germ of this splendid development,
and watched and guarded its growth.” There is
one characteristic feature of the discovery of lithography for
which Senefelder ought to receive the fullest credit. Unlike
other discoveries of industrial and scientific value, there can
be no doubt whatever as to its origin. Senefelder’s claim has
never been disputed, yet “the payment of a debt of gratitude
to the fact is easily overlooked when the wheel of history
has made another turn.”</p>

<p>It has been again and again suggested that the blighting
influences of Commercialism have robbed lithography of many
of its traditional features and a few, at least, of its best and
most artistic qualities as a reproductive art. This same
commercial spirit, however, has inspired and encouraged a
charming variety of effect both in colour and design, and
lithography of to-day, in almost every form of its manifestation,
is infinitely more attractive and capable of considerably
more expressive power than could ever have been hoped for
before commercial utility and value demanded a full recognition.
Pleasing and harmonious effects, which are almost<a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"><span class="pagenum">[vi]</span></a>
invariably sought after in lithography, need not be inartistic;
and it is quite possible for the technique of the lithographic
draughtsman to translate original work without a serious depreciation
of its pictorial and artistic value.</p>

<p>While expressing a sincere hope that this volume may
be of considerable assistance to his fellow-craftsmen, the
writer wishes to emphasise the fact that resourcefulness and
intelligent application are faculties which may be encouraged
and amplified but cannot be imparted even by volumes of
text.</p>

<p>A mere formal acknowledgment of assistance cordially
rendered by the editors of the <i>British Printer</i> and <i>The Caxton
Magazine</i> and <i>Press</i>, Messrs. Penrose &amp; Co., and other firms
whose blocks are <i>primâ facie</i> evidences of their interest, does
not adequately express the appreciation with which it has
been accepted and made use of.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Concerning Stones&mdash;Character and Texture&mdash;Some Simple Elements&mdash;Preparation
of Stones&mdash;Planing and Levelling&mdash;Grinding Grained
Stones&mdash;Descriptive Treatment&mdash;American Method.</div>

<p>There are a vast number of details in connection with
lithography and lithographic printing which are indisputably
elementary in their character. It would be impossible,
however, to regard them as non-essential, and a just
appreciation of their value and influence must of necessity
enter into any comprehensive exposition of the craft.</p>

<p><i>Stone as a printing medium.</i>&mdash;The value of the Bavarian
limestone was one of those fortunate discoveries which
tended to materialise lithography as a graphic art, and
may even be regarded as a fundamental principle, the
practical value of which is only equalled by its far-reaching
effects.</p>

<p>Other printing surfaces have been discovered and
developed, with more or less substantial results, yet without
depreciating their merits, it will be but a fair recognition
to concede the premier position to the Solenhofen
and other limestones of a like nature.</p><p><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"><span class="pagenum">[2]</span></a></p>

<p>The homogeneity and porosity of these stones render
them peculiarly suitable for lithographic purposes, and it
undoubtedly reflects a vast amount of credit upon Senefelder
that even at the outset he should select a medium
so well adapted and in every way so eminently suitable
for graphic reproduction.</p>

<p>I have already, and almost inadvertently, indicated the
peculiar value of the Bavarian stone, for homogeneity and
porosity of texture are absolutely essential properties, and
upon these is based almost every theory which has assisted
in the development of this craft. These properties, in conjunction
with a suitable greasy pigment, provide the requisite
materials for that cause and effect which require and compel
consideration.</p>

<p>The simple elements of lithography may be very briefly
described, and in this direction at least we must follow
certain well-defined lines which may be regarded as well-worn
ruts, the consideration of which offers little that
is new.</p>

<p>A brief review of the theories of chemical and mechanical
affinities is best calculated to impress upon the mind
the elementary principles of the lithographer’s art.</p>

<p>The penetrative power of a greasy pigment, together with
the porous nature of the litho-stone, may be regarded as the
cause by which the lithographer produces as an effect a
design or impression which, to some extent, enters into the
texture of the stone&mdash;the homogeneity of which checks any
tendency to <i>spread</i>. This fatty matter may be applied in one
or two ways, either as a transfer from some other printing
surface, or as a direct drawing with pen, brush, or crayon.</p>

<p>The first question for consideration will be the initial
preparation of the litho-stones. These preparatory operations&mdash;which
have for their object the levelling, polishing,
and cleaning of the stones&mdash;were at one time entirely performed<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"><span class="pagenum">[3]</span></a>
by hand labour, but are now accomplished with
much greater facility and in a more effective manner by
machinery. The importance of each individual operation
will be more readily appreciated when once its purpose
is clearly understood. A litho-stone having a <i>perfectly level</i>
surface is necessary in order to enable the printer to secure
a firm and uniform pressure over the whole design when
printing therefrom. A <i>smooth</i>, <i>polished</i> surface will readily
receive the finest designs, and retain all their original
characteristics. A <i>clean</i> surface is an absolute necessity, <i>i.e.</i>
a chemically clean surface free from grease or any foreign
matter which would be likely to enter into the texture of
the stone and by so doing injure any greasy drawing or
transfer which might be made thereon.</p>

<p>These are simple, elementary principles, and as such
are probably familiar to every reader, but the frequent
result of familiarity is a dangerous tendency to under-estimate
the importance of everyday causes and effects.
If, therefore, such a reference as the above to common
details serves to convey some intelligent idea of their place
and true value, then no apology whatever will be necessary
for their insertion in this volume. It has already been
stated that, in the preparation of litho-stones, the superseding
of hand labour by machinery has effected considerable
and important changes.</p>

<p>Several machines, all of more or less practical value,
have been introduced to the trade. One of the more
recent developments, a stone-planing machine, possesses
many features of real merit (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The stone is securely fixed on a perfectly true bed and
passes slowly to and fro beneath the blades of powerful
cutting knives. These blades are arranged in an inverted
V-shape and locked in an oscillating framework. By an
automatic action they are almost imperceptibly lowered at<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></a>
each traverse of the machine, when they lightly cut away
the surface of the stone until the old work is completely
removed and a smooth level face is assured. The chief
objection to this type of machine is that in course of time
the knives become worn and slightly irregular, and it is
but reasonable to suppose that when a number of small
stones have been operated upon and immediately afterwards
a full-sized stone is planed, such irregularities will be very
pronounced and detrimental.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="600" height="286" alt="Stone-planing Machine." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Many machines have been designed on the simple grinding
principle, but one type differs from its contemporaries
and offers several distinct advantages over them (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>This machine is constructed on hand-polishing lines,
<i>i.e.</i> the movements are to some extent mechanical arrangements
of hand-polishing principles. The size of stone
makes no difference whatever, and the results are in the
main uniform and satisfactory. The inconveniently sharp
edges, such as are produced by the planing machine, are
unknown,&mdash;the wear and tear on the stone is perceptibly
lessened, and the power required to drive such a machine
is not by any means a serious matter.</p>

<p>When a planing machine does not enter into the operation,
and grinding by hand is therefore necessary, sharp,<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"><span class="pagenum">[5]</span></a>
clean sand should be used as a grinding medium. To
secure some degree of uniformity in the grain, and at the
same time remove all the larger particles of grit, pass the
sand first through a fine sieve. The harder qualities of
sand have, of course, the greatest cutting power, and
therefore are the most suitable for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig_2" id="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" width="600" height="563" alt="Stone-polishing Machine." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></span>
</div>

<p>When hand-grinding is resorted to, a continuous elliptical
motion of one stone over the other with a slight twist from
the wrist will prove most effective.</p>

<p>To finish the grinding, and as far as possible remove
the deeper sand scratches, work off the sand in the form
of a <i>sludge</i>. Unless this operation is carefully and patiently
performed, scratches of considerable depth may appear on<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></a>
various parts of the stone’s surface. These, in the subsequent
polishing, may offer a strong temptation to the
operator to work over one part of the stone more than
another, so as to effect the removal of such scratches with
greater rapidity. The almost certain result of this would
be an uneven surface, which would in many ways prove
troublesome to the printer.</p>

<p><i>The graining of stones.</i>&mdash;This is a matter concerning the
preparation of stones which must not be overlooked. The
introduction of shading mediums and other contrivances of
a similar character has considerably minimised the importance
of the grained stone, inasmuch as it cannot now be regarded
as an indispensable feature of lithography. It is, however,
still of inestimable value, and will probably always find a
place and purpose in the practice of lithography, despite
its depreciation owing to present-day limitations.</p>

<p>Recognising, then, the possibility of its retention, at least
for some time to come, as a suitable printing surface upon
which the lithographic draughtsman can work with undoubted
facility of execution and effect, we must perforce
include a brief description of its preparation in this chapter.</p>

<p>First of all, level the stone and to some extent polish
it, after which the graining may be proceeded with. A
glass muller about 6 or 7 inches in diameter makes an
excellent “grainer.” Failing this, a handy substitute will
be found in the form of a small litho-stone, hard in texture,
and with a smooth, level surface. Use as a graining medium
sharp, clean silver sand only, passing it carefully through a
sieve according to the size or depth of the grain required.
Sprinkle a little of this sand uniformly over the stone under
treatment, together with a few drops of clean water. With
a continuous circular movement pass the graining muller
from end to end of the stone, exerting a firm and uniform
pressure. Repeat this operation again and again, adding<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></a>
sand and water as required. Considerable time coupled
with intelligent application will be necessary to carry out
this work successfully. Should the sand become too much
worn before its renewal the grain will in proportion lose
its “tooth” or sharpness. On the other hand lies the
danger of producing a grain which is too harsh or pronounced.
Therefore much depends upon the skill and
judgment of the operator. A safe plan is to ascertain the
progress at any time when a satisfactory result might be
reasonably expected. The best way to accomplish this is
by washing from the face of the stone any accumulation of
sand, and drying it, so that a test can be made with the
actual grade of crayon to be used in the subsequent
drawing. A powerful current of clean, cold water affords
the best means for removing every trace of sand from
the finished stone, and will leave it in a condition of almost
complete readiness for the draughtsman; a good drying is then
all that is necessary. Good results have been claimed for a
method of graining which was introduced by the Americans
a few years ago. In this process the grain is produced by
sprinkling the surface of the stone with sand and rolling
it with small glass balls. These balls having a limited
area in which to work exert a continuous cutting power without
any tendency to produce scratches. Some mechanical
arrangement is necessary to impart this continuous rolling
movement to the glass balls and to maintain a uniform
speed. It is quite easy to understand that with such a
process, carried out under favourable conditions, very fine
results might be produced with great rapidity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lithographic Transfer Inks</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Various Forms&mdash;Distinguishing Features&mdash;Formulæ&mdash;Writing Transfer
Ink&mdash;Stone-to-stone Transfer Ink&mdash;Copperplate Transfer Ink&mdash;A
Modification.</div>

<p>Given a perfectly clean and smooth polished stone as
described in the previous chapter, the next important point
is the composition of the fatty matter wherewith a design
or drawing is applied.</p>

<p>As already stated, the active principle in any suitable
transfer medium of this character is invariably the same,
no matter what form its composition takes. For applying
with pen or brush it must possess soluble properties, and of
necessity be reduced to a liquid form. Such soluble properties,
however, must not interfere with its fatty properties,
these latter being essential features.</p>

<p>In crayon or <i>chalk</i> drawing the composition must be
employed in a concrete form, as a crayon, the hardness and
texture of which will be controlled (1) by the character of
the work to be carried out; (2) by the character of surface
to be operated upon.</p>

<p>Transfers from other printing surfaces can only be made
when the composition used is in the form of a pigment, and
reduced to a convenient working consistency.</p>

<p>These, then, comprise the varieties of transfer mediums
which are likely to be required in most phases of commercial
lithography. Others are, of course, employed for specific<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></a>
purposes and under peculiar conditions; but these, again, are
more or less modifications of existing formulæ, prepared to
meet particular requirements.</p>

<p>The ink used for transferring impressions from one printing
surface to another, <i>e.g.</i>, the re-transferring of work from
stone to stone, may with a very slight alteration serve for
type to stone transfer; but a considerable departure must
be effected to produce a satisfactory photo-litho transfer ink,
while a composition of a peculiarly distinctive character will
be requisite for the successful production of transfers from
copperplate engravings, as well as for a transfer ink for
writing and drawing on stone or transfer paper. This
writing transfer ink must be soluble in water, yet without
becoming slimy; otherwise it will not work freely with the
pen or brush. It must also dry quickly, and without any
tendency to smear.</p>

<p>A plate transfer ink must neither melt nor drag when
applied to the hot plate. It must, of course, soften sufficiently
to fill in the lines of the engraving, and should so
harden as it cools that it cannot easily be dragged away
during the cleaning and polishing operations. See Chap. IV.
<a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>.</p>

<p>Each and all of the above inks must be excessively
greasy and penetrative, but without having the slightest
tendency to spread superficially. The ingredients and
methods of preparation specified in the succeeding paragraphs
are not given as standard formulæ, but in corroboration of
statements made, and as practical illustrations of the character
and purpose of transfer inks and compositions generally.</p>

<p><i>Transfer ink.</i>&mdash;Writing transfer ink, for writing or
drawing on stone or transfer paper, may consist of equal
quantities of:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="lismall">
<li>Castile soap,</li>
<li>Wax,</li>
<li>Tallow,</li>
<li>Shellac,</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></a></p>

<p>with the addition of carbon black or black printing ink as a
colouring matter. Another reliable formula is:&mdash;</p>


<table class="tablesm" summary="tb1">
<tr><td>Soap</td><td>4 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tallow</td><td>3 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wax</td><td>6 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shellac</td><td>4 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Carbon black</td><td>1 parts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Whichever formula is adopted the method of preparation
is the same combination.</p>

<p>Free the soap from all moisture by drying, and thus
facilitate its combining with the other ingredients.</p>

<p>Melt the tallow and wax over a hot fire until they are
thoroughly well mixed. Add the dried soap a little at a
time, so that it may become thoroughly incorporated with
the wax and tallow. Bring the mixture to boiling-point,
then remove it from the fire or stove and ignite the fumes
which will then be rising freely. Continue the burning
process for about fifteen minutes, then extinguish the flames
by replacing the lid of the pan. The shellac and black
may be added while the composition is cooling.</p>

<p><i>Stone-to-stone re-transfer ink.</i>&mdash;The ingredients of this
ink consist of:&mdash;</p>


<ul class="lismall">
<li>4 oz. Transfer ink.</li>
<li>4 oz. Litho black ink.</li>
<li>4 oz. Medium varnish.</li>
<li>1 oz. Canada balsam.</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the transfer ink over a slow fire and add the other
ingredients separately.</p>

<p>Canada balsam will not only add to the effectiveness of
this ink, but it will also improve its working qualities.</p>

<p><i>Copperplate transfer ink.</i>&mdash;Ingredients consist of:&mdash;</p>


<ul class="lismall">
<li>1 oz. Tallow.</li>
<li>3 oz. Bee’s wax.</li>
<li>4 oz. Shellac.</li>
<li>2 oz. Soap.</li>
<li>4 oz. Bitumen.</li>
<li>1 oz. Canada balsam.</li>
<li>1 oz. Carbon black.</li>
</ul>


<p>The method in this case differs somewhat from the<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></a>
preceding. First melt the bitumen and then add the wax
and soap in small pieces as before. Burn this for fifteen
minutes, and add the shellac, balsam, and black, boiling
the whole gently for forty minutes. Mould into squares
or sticks, and for convenience in handling cover these with
tinfoil.</p>

<p>Should an extra powerful ink be required for shading
or stippling films, the stone-to-stone re-transfer ink can be
reduced to a working consistency with castor oil instead
of varnish, and thus rendered suitable for this purpose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lithographic Transfer Papers</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Essential Features&mdash;Varnish Transfer Paper&mdash;Damp-stone Transfer
Paper&mdash;French Transparent Transfer Paper&mdash;Copperplate Transfer
Paper&mdash;An Alternative Recipe&mdash;Granulated Papers&mdash;Photo-litho
Transfer Paper.</div>

<p>Transfer papers are even more used than the transfer
compositions already described, and in greater variety, in
consequence of which there is a wide difference of opinion
concerning their merits.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the specific value of any transfer
paper must depend upon local conditions. That which might
be of the utmost value to one printer would in all probability
fail to meet the requirements of another. With these also,
as with the transfer inks, the main point is to grasp the
general principles involved. Adhering to these principles
enables any intelligent workman to adapt the transfers to his
own peculiar necessity. It is most important that lithographic
transfer paper should be absolutely impervious to the transfer
composition or ink, so that an impression of full strength can
be conveyed to the stone, leaving its greasy properties unimpaired.
The paper therefore must undergo special preparation,
and here again the character of the work and the conditions
under which it is carried out are the chief controlling
elements. So much is this the case that many lithographic
printers prefer to make their own transfer paper, and find
such a procedure eminently satisfactory.</p><p><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></a></p>

<p>A good bank post double foolscap paper, about 26
lb., first thinly coated with a solution of concentrated
size and afterwards varnished with a heavy coach body
varnish, gives excellent results. When transferring large
work in which a number of printings are involved, and
where accuracy of register is a <i>sine quâ non</i>, the following
mixture may, if desired, be substituted for the coach body
varnish:&mdash;</p>


<table class="tablesm" summary="tb2">
<tr><td>Best oak varnish</td><td>1 quart.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Turpentine</td><td>½ pint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Boiled linseed oil</td><td>½ pint.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Paper thus prepared rarely stretches or becomes distorted to
any appreciable extent, and can be used with equally good
results on either cold or warm stones.</p>

<p>Its keeping qualities are, however, limited; it is therefore
advisable to utilise the transfer impressions with as little
delay as possible.</p>

<p>This may be criticised as a somewhat primitive and
old-fashioned transfer paper; but of the many transfer
papers now in use, none can claim to be exactly new.</p>

<p>Another stone-to-stone transfer paper of the simplest
possible character can be made by coating a good writing
paper with the following composition. Soak 3 oz. of glue
in 6 oz. of water for about 8 hours. Reduce 1 lb. of
starch to a thick, creamy paste by rubbing it down in a
little cold water and then adding boiling water until the
required consistency is obtained. Mix the starch and
glue together, and add a little gamboge or cochineal
as colouring matter, so as to enable the printer to
see at a glance which is the coated side of the paper.
Spread this composition on the paper while it is still
warm.</p>

<p>A transparent transfer paper with a soluble coating is
frequently desirable, and for certain purposes may be strongly<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></a>
recommended. A French transfer paper meets such a requirement,
and at the same time possesses many other
excellent qualities. It picks up a firm, clean impression, and
transfers every particle of it to the stone. It is also transparent,
and sufficiently adhesive to stick to a very slightly
damped stone under a light pressure.</p>

<p>A transfer paper which may be used as a base upon
which to write or draw a design for subsequent transference
to stone, as well as for stone-to-stone transferring,
should be coated with a composition of a gelatinous
character, which will not be readily soluble in water.
Writing transfer ink is of course dissolved in water, and
its effect on a soft, soluble composition would be disastrous.</p>

<p>The following formula is suggestive as well as practical:&mdash;</p>

<table class="tablesm" summary="tb3">
<tr><td>Gelatine</td><td>4 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Isinglass</td><td>6 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flake white</td><td>3 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gamboge</td><td>2 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Make a strong size of the above by boiling the gelatine
and isinglass with a little water. Mix the gamboge and
flake white with a little warm water, and add the mixture to
the gelatine solution. This composition must be applied to
the paper while still quite warm, as it forms into a comparatively
stiff jelly while cooling. This paper should be
transferred to warm stones.</p>

<p>Copperplate transfer paper is to some extent a development
of the variety just described; that is, if the
conditions under which such transfers are made will bear
comparison with operations of an essentially different
character.</p>

<p>The composition used for coating copperplate transfer
paper must possess a somewhat heavy body, and for this<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></a>
reason plaster of paris enters into its composition, which is
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="tablesm" summary="tb4">
<tr><td>Plaster of paris</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flake white</td><td>1 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flour</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fish glue</td><td>¼ lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alum</td><td>1 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Soak the alum and glue from 8 to 10 hours, and then boil
them until they are dissolved. Make the flour into a smooth
paste by the addition of a little water, and mix it with the
flake white. Mix the plaster of paris with water, and stir
continuously until it becomes incapable of setting. Add the
other ingredients, already mixed, and see that they become
thoroughly incorporated with the plaster of paris, after which
coat the paper twice with the mixture.</p>

<p>The following may be substituted for the above:&mdash;</p>

<table class="tablesm" summary="tb5">
<tr><td>Plaster of paris</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flour</td><td>2 lb.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gelatine</td><td>4 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A transfer paper with its surface granulated to represent a
mechanical stipple, or the texture of a grained stone, may be
prepared in the following manner. Take of:&mdash;</p>

<table class="tablesm" summary="tb6">
<tr><td>Starch</td><td>9 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parchment chippings</td><td>12 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flake white</td><td>14 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Prepare the starch as previously described, and dissolve the
isinglass by boiling. Mix the flake white into a thin paste
by the addition of water. Warm the three ingredients, and
mix the whole thoroughly. Coat a fairly heavy printing
paper twice with this composition, and when it is thoroughly
dry give it the required granulation by means of grained
stones or engraved plates. The grain thus imparted breaks
up the drawing into a series of minute dots. Paper of this
description is most suitable for pencil or crayon work. Its<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></a>
usefulness is obvious. It enables the artist to use his chalks
in the usual manner, without the inconvenience of handling
large stones. No graining of the stone is necessary, and the
grained effect can be confined to any portion of the design.</p>

<p>Photo-litho transfer paper is in every respect a specific
article, the coating of which consists of a gelatinous emulsion,
which can be readily sensitised, and upon which a photographic
image can be developed. Special preparation and
manipulation are therefore necessary in connection with its
production, and these points will be fully dealt with in a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>One more variety of transfer paper should be mentioned,
namely, the diaphanic, which possesses excellent qualities for
certain classes of work. It is very transparent, and extremely
useful in the tracing of key formes, or for making
facsimile drawings for immediate transference to stone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Copperplate Transfer Printing</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">The Copperplate Press&mdash;The Operation&mdash;Charging the Engraved Plate&mdash;Cleaning-off
and Polishing&mdash;Making the Impression&mdash;Useful
Notions.</div>

<p>Although copperplate printing may not now be so extensively
practised as in years gone by, it is not, so far as we can
judge, very likely to be
superseded in the near
future. It is still regarded
as a necessary adjunct
to lithography, especially
where the amount of commercial
work produced is
of any moment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;"><a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="318" height="450" alt="Copperplate Press." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></span>
</div>

<p>From a purely mechanical
point of view the
construction of the copperplate
press (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) is
of an exceedingly simple
character. Its primary
purpose is to produce a
heavy and uniform pressure
on the plate during
operation.</p>

<p>After being charged with a special pigment and cleaned as
hereafter described, the plate is laid, face upwards, on the iron<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></a>
bed or table of the press and in contact with the paper, and
passed through between two iron cylinders. These cylinders
are so adjusted as to produce an exceptionally heavy pressure.
Such are the simple elements of a process which,
however, requires much closer investigation.</p>

<p>In its application to lithography the following are the
only requisites for copperplate transfer printing.</p>

<p>A stick of prepared transfer ink&mdash;whiting, free from
grit&mdash;transfer paper, and a plentiful supply of soft rags.
Likewise, an iron plate with a gas jet underneath (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>),
a square of printer’s blanket, and a damp book consisting
of twenty or thirty sheets of blotting or other absorbent
paper slightly and uniformly

<p>A good copperplate
transfer paper can be
made according to the
recipe given in <a href="#Page_12">Chap. III.</a>,
but unless a fairly large
quantity is used the commercial
qualities will be
found most economical.</p>

<p>Copperplate printing, in its application to lithography,
is a simple operation, but it requires extraordinary care
for its successful execution. The conditions under which
lithographic transfers are made from a copperplate engraving
are vastly different from those which control copperplate
printing for ordinary purposes of reproduction.</p>

<p>The engraved plate is first well heated by means of the
hot plate already mentioned. The transfer ink is then
<i>forced</i> into the engraved parts until every line is fully
charged, the ink having been previously enclosed in a
double fold of soft rag.</p>

<p>During this part of the operation great care must be<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></a>
taken that the transfer ink does not burn through overheating,
as this would partially destroy its greasy nature
and leave it hard and brittle. The transfer impression
would suffer in consequence, and, though to all appearance
perfect on the paper, it would be weak and ineffective when
applied to the lithographic stone. Such an error of judgment
is not at all unusual, and should therefore be the
more carefully guarded against. It frequently occurs without
the knowledge of the operator, owing, it may be, to his over-anxiety
to complete his work in as short a time as possible.</p>

<p>The plate must now be cleaned, <i>i.e.</i> the surplus ink and
scum must all be removed. This may be done before the
plate is quite cool, and after a little experience it will be possible
to accomplish the cleansing process without in any way
disturbing the ink in the lines of the engraving. The rag
used for cleaning must be tightly folded into the form of a
pad and kept free from creases. After final cleansing and
polishing with whiting the plate is ready for an impression.
The transfer paper requires damping until it is quite limp,
when it is brought into contact with the inked plate and
subjected to a very heavy pressure. The backing is a
woollen blanket, preferably of fine texture; this ensures
perfect contact between the plate and the paper. The plate
is now very slightly warmed to dry the transfer paper, which
is allowed to peel off; this it does very readily if, after
a little while, the corners and edges are but slightly eased.</p>

<p>Oil of tar will effectually remove any accretions of copperplate
transfer ink which may have hardened in the lines of
the engraving.</p>

<p>It may be useful also to know that it is possible to use
a small lithographic press in place of a copperplate press,
assuming, of course, that a sufficiently heavy and uniform
pressure can be guaranteed. This is not altogether an
innovation, yet it is not a familiar notion.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lithographic Press</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Mechanical Principles&mdash;Constructive Details&mdash;Scraper&mdash;Tympan&mdash;Practical
Suggestions&mdash;Elastic Bedding.</div>

<p>It is not a little surprising to find that the mechanical
principle of the lithographic press in general use to-day is
almost identical with that which the pioneers of the craft
employed so successfully. This is an interesting fact which
either reflects much credit upon the ingenuity of the early
lithographic printers or points to an unreasonable conservatism
on the part of the present-day craftsmen. A discussion of
this phase of the question would be of doubtful interest, for
the practical printer has long been accustomed to regard it
simply as a convenient appliance for the production of a
heavy and readily adjustable pressure.</p>

<p>A brief examination will prove to what extent these
requirements are fulfilled by the modern lithographic press
(<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>The simplicity of its construction suggests a first point
for favourable criticism. In fact, its general mechanical
arrangements are so exceedingly simple that the merest
tyro might readily understand their principles and
purpose.</p>

<p>The adjustability of the pressure by means of the screw D
(<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>) is both effective and necessary, owing to the constantly
varying thickness of the lithographic stones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig_5" id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="600" height="424" alt="Lithographic Press." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The pressure of the boxwood scraper B on the surface of<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><span class="pagenum">[21]</span></a>
the stone is perfectly rigid, and yet, owing to the intervention
of the tympan C, is sufficiently elastic to ensure the closest
possible contact. <a href="#Figs_6_and_7">Figs. 6 and 7</a> show one or two constructive
details by which the hand lever A and the cam
motion E bring up the cylinder F to the bottom of the
carriage or bed of the press, <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>It is in this position that the movement of the carriage
gives the necessary pressure required to pull an impression.
The shaft H runs across the press and operates a similar cam
to E on the opposite side. These two cams raise the brass
block G and give the requisite support to the cylinder F
when the pressure is applied.</p>

<p>These are the chief characteristics of the lithographic
press, and as such they require not a little attention and
intelligent manipulation. It is practically impossible to<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></a>
secure a steady and uniform pressure unless the scraper
and tympan are carefully adjusted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Figs_6_and_7" id="Figs_6_and_7"></a>
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="300" height="366" alt="Details of Lithographic Press." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 6 and 7.</span>
</div>

<p>The former must be perfectly true with its V-shaped edge
nicely rounded, and the latter tightly stretched on the frame
C so that it will not sag or bulge when pressure is applied
and the scraper passes over it. To reduce the enormous
friction caused by this pressure the back of the tympan is
usually dressed with a mixture of tallow and plumbago, a
dressing which requires frequent renewal. The plumbago
possesses but little body, and its salutary effect soon passes
away. To prevent this and to increase its adhesiveness it
is sometimes mixed with a little
gum. A mineral black which is
found in large quantities in the
west of England is even more
effective than plumbago for this
purpose. It forms a strong and
flexible dressing for the leather,
is peculiarly adhesive and provides
an efficient lubricant.</p>

<p>It is a decided advantage to
have two tympans in use, one for
small stones and another for the
larger sizes. It is obviously
unwise to pull a number of impressions from small
stones with a large tympan, for if this practice is persisted
in the tympan leather not only loses its shape, but becomes
perceptibly thinner on such parts as may have been most
subjected to pressure.</p>

<p>For similar reasons it is advisable to have a number of
boxwood scrapers of different sizes. The “dents” produced
by a small stone on a large scraper can only be removed by
planing.</p>

<p>In lithographic press work some form of elastic bedding<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></a>
placed underneath the stone will not only materially assist
the pressure, but will also minimise the risk of breakages. In
fact, the pressure is frequently so keen and of such a direct
character as to render this arrangement little short of a
necessity. Extra thick linoleum will serve this purpose
admirably, and a zinc covering for this bedding will complete
the equipment of the lithographic press.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Preparing the Design&mdash;Treatment of an Ink Drawing&mdash;Chalk Drawings&mdash;Alterations&mdash;Value

Hand-roller&mdash;Proving&mdash;Registration&mdash;General Features&mdash;Transferring&mdash;A
Commercial Necessity&mdash;Arrangement&mdash;Choice of Paper&mdash;Transference
to Stone&mdash;Preparing the Forme.</div>

<p>The operations directly associated with lithographic press
work are more or less of a preparatory character. The
preparation of a design, in its progressive stages, from the
lithographic draughtsman to the printing machine, is usually
carried out in conjunction with the press. Only under
exceptional conditions or for some particular class of work
is the lithographic press actually employed for printing
purposes. Its ready adaptability to the ever-varying thickness
of lithographic stones, and the manner in which pressure
can be applied at will, as well as the intense sharpness
of such pressure, render it peculiarly suitable for the work
now under discussion. Such operations will be better understood
and probably more easily remembered if they are
described in a sequence such as might be presented under
average commercial conditions. Taking a design as it leaves
the lithographic draughtsman, <i>i.e.</i> in the form of a greasy
drawing on stone, the first object of the printer is to so
prepare it as to preserve the conditions described in Chap. I.
<a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>. This he may accomplish in the following manner.</p>

<p>Cover the whole stone with fresh strong gum and allow
it to dry. Then if it be an ink drawing, wash off the<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></a>
gum with water, and remove the drawing ink from the
surface of the design with a few drops of turpentine
and a piece of clean rag. Proceed to roll up with a
lithographic hand-roller charged with good black printing
ink. The consistency of this printing ink can only be
determined by the character of the work under treatment.
It is therefore a matter of experience rather than rule.
Heavy designs covering large areas can be worked up with
moderately thin ink, while work of a finer description will
most probably require a stronger ink for its successful
treatment. Between these two extremes there is a
variety of conditions and effects which will require a
ready recognition and an intelligent adaptation or modification
of any operation which may be described. It may even
be advisable to <i>rub up</i> the work with a piece of soft rag and
printing ink, but the clearness and crispness of the drawing
can best be preserved by a complete removal of the greasy
ink with which the drawing was originally made. More
particularly is this desirable when heavy, solid work is in
close contact with work of a finer description, for the excessively
greasy character of the artist’s drawing ink has
a dangerous tendency to smear or spread and to thicken
the design, unless a reasonable amount of care is exercised.
After rolling up the work as well as possible, and having
decided that it is firm and strong and is fully charged
with ink, dry the stone perfectly and dust over the
design with finely powdered resin or French chalk. With
a piece of water of Ayr stone polish away any scum or
dirt which may surround the work, and etch it quickly
with a weak solution of nitric acid. Cover up with strong
gum and dry it. The design is now ready either for proving
or transferring.</p>

<p>The treatment of chalk drawings, grained stones, or
transfers from grained paper needs a slight variation of the<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></a>
operations already described. The preliminary etching is
generally carried out by the draughtsman by flooding the
stone with a mixture of gum and acid, after which the
gum solution is allowed to dry. The chemical change which
takes place during this etching is often described as one in
which the soap present in lithographic chalks is changed
to an insoluble compound. This chemical change is perhaps
a somewhat contentious matter, but the effect and
not the principle involved is to us the matter of primary
importance, and this effect is such as to actually prevent any
spreading of the design on the stone beyond the lines of
the original drawing.</p>

<p>Returning once more to the operation, wash off the gum,
and, having removed the excess of water in the usual way,
roll up firmly with a strong black ink. Instead of washing
out the drawing with turpentine immediately, work off the
original chalk by rolling up with a good nap roller and taking
frequent impressions. In this way the grain of the drawing
will be gradually developed and rendered fit for further
operations. The stone can then be passed to the prover
or transferrer.</p>

<p>A French writer, in referring to the importance of really
good <i>chalk</i> drawing and printing, as well as to its artistic
and technical value, once said: “The printer requires a fair
appreciation of that subtle suggestiveness which gradations
of tone can impart to a chalk drawing before he can hope
to successfully reproduce the artist’s original conception. A
good printer handles his roller over a chalk drawing with
the same feeling as that with which a violin player handles
his bow. By movements rapid or slow, and by greater or
less pressure over certain parts, he charges the drawing to
the proper tone.”</p>

<p>If at any time the original work requires alterations,
they may be executed in the following manner. Roll up<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></a>
the design firmly in strong, black ink, and, after fanning
the surface dry, dust it over with French chalk. Make
the necessary erasures with water of Ayr stone and etch
with fairly strong nitric acid. Polish slightly, and wash
well with a plentiful supply of clean water. Pour over
the stone a very weak solution of alum, and again wash
thoroughly with hot water, so that its rapid evaporation
may leave the work ready for immediate manipulation.
Alterations may be made by transferring or drawing. In
either case it is advisable to gum up the work with strong
gum and allow it to stand until dry. The subsequent
treatment of any alteration will, of course, depend upon
their character and extent. As new work, they should
be carefully handled.</p>

<p>It is most important that a very <i>weak</i> solution of alum
should be used. Being an alkali, a strong solution would
have a tendency to dissolve the greasy particles of the
drawing and cause them to spread and thicken.</p>

<p>It is always advisable to take an impression from each
design, whether it be in ink or crayon, before it is laid aside
for subsequent manipulation. These impressions will not
only reveal any inaccuracies or weaknesses which might otherwise
pass unnoticed, but also serve as a useful record and
for comparison with other transfers or impressions which
may be required.</p>

<p>There are other phases of preparatory work which come
within the scope of the lithographic pressman, and as they
frequently constitute an intermediary stage between the first
drawing of the draughtsman on stone and the making of
transfer impressions to facilitate reproduction, a description
at this point will be appropriate.</p>

<p>It may be that a key forme only has been prepared, or
perhaps an outline forme with sufficient detail. In either
case a number of offsets equivalent to the number of colours<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></a>
necessary for the completion of the design will be required.
These are made by taking good, solid impressions in stiff
black ink from the key or outline forme. Dust these over
with a mixture of three parts Venetian red and one part
lamp-black. Lay them in convenient positions on a well-polished
dry stone, and run them through the lithographic
press with a light yet firm pressure. The result will be faint
yet sufficiently clear offsets of an outline which will enable
the lithographic draughtsman to prepare any number of
formes, and these will register or fit each other and the original
drawing with perfect accuracy. Such outlines will in no way
affect the work of the draughtsman, and will disappear at the
first application of the gum sponge or moisture in any form.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_9" id="Fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="400" height="84" alt="Lithographic Hand Roller." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A lithographic <i>nap</i>-roller (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>) facilitates the work of
the pressman in the
preparation and development
of original
drawings on stone,
and becomes an absolute
necessity when crayon drawings on grained stones are
operated upon. The preparation and preservation of a roller
of this description requires a more than average amount of
care and attention. The best rollers are covered with
French calf-skin with a soft, velvet-like nap, and may be
prepared as follows. Run the roller in crude castor oil for
a short time until the leather becomes soft and pliable, then
work out the superfluous oil by repeated rolling in medium
varnish, occasionally scraping off the varnish with a broad
blunt knife. Continue this for a day or two, then gradually
work into the skin some good non-drying black printing
ink. The roller thus prepared may be somewhat harsh, but
a few days’ use will bring it into condition. An occasional
application of tallow or lard, say about once a week, will
keep the roller skin soft and pliable, and counteract the<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></a>
hardening effect of constant contact with the damp surface of
the lithographic stone and the oxidisation of the printing ink.</p>

<p>Proving the work of the lithographic artist, though not
always an absolute necessity, is a helpful and most important
function. In its progressive stage it enables both designer
and lithographer to observe the realisation of their colour
schemes, and to amplify or minimise if necessary the effects
they desire to produce. Errors of judgment or of detail can
be rectified before the work reaches a more advanced stage.
Again, a finished proof offers something of a tangible character
for an expression of approval or disapproval, and serves as
a useful and helpful guide to the printer throughout the
subsequent operations.</p>

<p>This will show clearly the importance of the prover’s
work, and though it is not by any means an unusual
proceeding to <i>prove up</i> even the most elaborate designs in
the lithographic printing machines, it is, for obvious reasons,
more convenient to confine such work to the press. It may
therefore be regarded as an intermediate operation, distinctly
apart from the preparation of the original drawing which
precedes it, and the arrangement for machine printing which
follows. The distinctive and pre-eminently the most important
feature of proving is the manner in which one colour
is registered with another; and although the methods usually
adopted are of the simplest possible character, the most
scrupulous care is requisite for their successful application.
It appears to be an almost ridiculous plan, so simple is it, to
cut away the angles formed by the register lines after the
first printing (<a href="#Fig_10a">Fig. 10<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a>), and then to place them to corresponding
lines on each colour forme, or to pierce the register lines as
in <a href="#Fig_10b">Fig. 10<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a>, passing a fine needle through each puncture into
corresponding holes drilled in the stones and allowing the
sheets to fall into position,&mdash;yet these operations demand
constant care and attention.</p><p><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10b.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The mixing of colours for proving, and the general
principle of their application, are matters which are almost
entirely under the control of the printer. Their selection
and the manner in which they are employed are both determined
by the individual character of the work. It is
impossible to indicate any “rule of thumb” guide for their
application or manipulation. The individual fancy of the
artist, or the wish of a customer, are the only probable
complications which may have to be considered. Then
again, many phases of the work are more or less experimental,
when the resourcefulness of the
printer may be tested, and the
mechanical features of his work
be relieved by the exercise of
intelligent application, if not of
artistic perception. Very rarely
is it possible to print from the
litho-draughtsman’s original drawing,
and even when it may be
convenient to do so, it is, in the
majority of cases, unadvisable on
account of the element of risk
involved. There is an ever-present danger of the stone
breaking,&mdash;a catastrophe which would necessitate an entire
reproduction of the design, and even under the most
favourable conditions the constant attrition produced by
the rollers, etc., would have an appreciable effect on the
work, and in course of time destroy its value for graphic
reproduction.</p>

<p>Many other equally cogent reasons why duplicates of the
original should be made for printing purposes present themselves.
The chief of these is an essentially commercial one.
To reproduce half a million impressions from a single small
drawing would obviously depreciate the commercial value of<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></a>
lithographic printing very considerably, and although there is
no record of the circumstances under which the duplicating
of original work by means of transfers was first evolved, it is
only reasonable to suppose that it was the direct outcome of
a necessity which was as peremptory in its demands as it has
been far-reaching in its effects. The method is one by which
any number of impressions can be made on a suitably prepared
paper, and with a sufficiently greasy pigment. These
can be re-transferred to a lithographic stone, and in this way
facsimiles of the original may be secured and arranged in
the manner most convenient for machine printing. Great
care is necessary in making these transfer impressions.
They must be perfectly solid, yet not overcharged with
ink, <i>i.e.</i> they must be clean and sharp, and as nearly an
exact replica of the original work as it is possible to make
them.</p>

<p>That the further description of these operations may be
as lucid and practical as possible, we will apply it to
ordinary work-a-day conditions, and suppose that a design in
three workings has been lithographed and prepared for transferring
as already described. The size of the work is 7¼ in. by
4½ in., then the paper on which it is to be printed ought
to be double crown, 20 in. by 30 in. This will allow 1½ in.
for the gripper and ½ in. margin at the back and sides.
Sixteen transfers can be pulled from each colour forme on a
thin, transparent transfer paper. Mark out a sheet of stout
paper as in <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, and arrange the transfers in the position
indicated by the dotted lines. The gripper margins A A
are determined by the construction of the machines, and may
be varied accordingly.</p>

<p>Varnished transfer papers may be laid down on a slightly
warmed dry stone, and if French transfer paper be used the
stone must be slightly damped. If the sheet of transfers is
laid down to a board&mdash;<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>&mdash;uniformity of gripper margin<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></a>
will be assured throughout the series, and the work of the
machine printer facilitated.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Pull it through the lithographic press with a gradually
increasing pressure in the usual way. The varnish transfer
paper will be sufficiently tacky to adhere slightly to the surface
of the stone, so that the pressure may be repeated again
and again with perfect safety. It may not be possible to
remove the base upon which they were arranged, as it is
usual to secure them in position with
paste. At this point the manipulation of
the two varieties of paper differs slightly.
The thin, transparent variety is usually
fastened down to its paper base with
syrup, glucose, or some sticky composition
of a similar character. This paper backing
can be removed immediately after
sufficient pressure has been applied to
fix the transfers to the stone. As this transfer paper is
adhesive it is necessary to damp the surface of the litho-stone
before it is laid down, when, of course, it will readily
adhere, even under a moderately light pressure.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a name="Fig_12" id="Fig_12"></a>

</div>

<p><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></a></p>

<p>The further preparation of work, after being transferred
in this manner, is in many respects similar to the treatment
of new work, but with this important difference. A new
transfer should almost invariably be worked up with a soft
rag and black ink, the latter being thinned down with turpentine
and varnish. Gum up the work, and allow the gum to
dry. Roll a piece of soft rag into a pad, and charge it with
printing ink which has been thinned down. Wipe off the
gum on the surface of the stone, leaving only a thin film over
the work. Rub up the transfers with the rag already prepared,
and when fully charged with ink cover them with
fresh gum. If possible they should stand for one or two
hours, when the rolling up and etching may be proceeded
with.</p>

<p>Accuracy of register can be ensured by the second and
third sets of transfers being patched up to the first forme in
the following manner.</p>

<p>Make two fairly strong black impressions of this forme on
a stout unstretchable paper. Fix these up on a glass frame
in such a position as to allow the light to pass through them,
and carefully place each transfer in its exact position. They
can then be laid down on separate stones in the same way as
the first set. These are the simple outlines of the transferring
process. In detail they may, of course, be modified to
meet the exigencies of peculiar conditions, which in lithography
are frequently the controlling powers, and at all times
are matters of vital importance.</p>

<p>Concerning the structural qualities of the various types of
lithographic printing machines now in use, much might be
written and divers opinions expressed. In this respect,
however, it would be invidious to suggest that one maker’s
machines were better than another’s, and such would be the
natural trend of a discussion on these lines. The machines
all have, it is true, many points in common where comparisons
would be legitimate and easy. Yet, on the other
hand, they each possess distinct advantages which will no
doubt appeal to the printer individually, in proportion to
their suitability or otherwise for his particular work. Conviction
will follow experience in these matters, and any
decision arrived at after this fashion may be regarded as a
useful and valuable acquisition.</p>

<p>The illustration on page 35 (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>) gives a fair general
idea of the modern lithographic machine.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a> illustrates a somewhat novel type of lithographic
printing machine, in which the gripper is entirely dispensed
with, the sheet being held to gauges by the operator until
caught between the small cylinder and the stone, when
pressure is immediately applied. The stone is simply blocked
up in the bed of the machine and the position of the print<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"><span class="pagenum">[35]</span></a>
on the paper assured by moving the gauges. This useful
little jobbing machine is a decided innovation, and the
simplicity of its construction is only equalled by the precision
of its movements.</p>

<p>Lithographic machine printing presents many peculiar
features, each one of which requires careful and constant
attention for their successful operation. Some of its purely
mechanical aspects&mdash;the care of the machine and its accessories,
together with their various functions and applications&mdash;offer
a wide scope for resourcefulness and ability of a high order.
The primary purpose of the machine itself was undoubtedly
to accelerate the reproductive power of lithography from a
commercial point of view; and throughout the entire course
of its development the aim of the engineer has been to
produce a printing machine with an ever-increasing capacity<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></a>
for reproduction. It does not follow, however, that the
printer’s responsibility has been proportionately increased.
Mechanical appliances have now so far superseded hand
labour that, apart from a thorough knowledge of the principles
of lithography, which is in itself essential, successful lithographic
machine printing is largely due to resourcefulness,
alert perception, and a skilful blending of mechanical and
technical knowledge.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Passing over the vast amount of detail which is usually
and almost invariably associated with machine printing, but
which offers little that is new to the practical worker, it
might be advantageous to discuss a few points which are too
often overlooked.</p>

<p>Speed, as has already been pointed out, is a very important
factor in lithographic machine printing. It has become quite
a necessity, and everything which conduces to it should
receive the most careful consideration. Economy of power is
too seldom regarded as a standard of efficiency in the printer.
At any rate, as far as this is concerned it is doubtful if he<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></a>
fully realises the effect of what may appear to him as
insignificant matters. A little pressure more or less on the
stone may be in itself a mere trifle, so also would be a careless
arrangement of the inking rollers or indiscriminate damping
of the stones, yet, when taken together, what a considerable
waste of power they might cause;&mdash;a waste which is
altogether unnecessary and could easily be obviated by care
and forethought. Excessive pressure is frequently resorted to
in order to “bring up” an impression which is defective owing
to some error of judgment in its preparation. It undoubtedly
secures the desired effect, but at what a cost! There is a
proportionately heavier drag on the machine and a greater
strain on its most vital parts. The following view of this
matter may be regarded as somewhat exaggerated, but it is by
no means an uncommon state of affairs, and will at least serve
to emphasise the importance of this point. It is a popular
fallacy to suppose that in adjusting the litho-stone to the
bed of the printing machine it should be made <i>perfectly level</i>.
As a matter of fact a much easier and more satisfactory
impression can be made from a stone which is worked just a
little higher at the front or gripper edge than at the back,
and for this reason. The drag on the cylinder as it makes
the impression is appreciably greater at the back than at the
front, and when the pressure is heavy it has a tendency to
leave the back edge with a very decided jerk. The remedy
is obvious and simple. As already suggested, the stone
should be set in the machine with the least possible inclination
towards the front. This adjustment is easily effected by a
judicious arrangement of a few layers of brown paper. Just
think for a moment of the effect likely to be produced by such
a jerk or jar, which would under ordinary working conditions
occur from twelve to fourteen times per minute whilst the
machine was in motion! Abnormal pressure would of course
intensify the strain, and sooner or later produce results of a<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></a>
decidedly disastrous character. Under the most favourable
conditions this continual springing would tend to move the
stone out of position, and thus affect the register of one forme
with another.</p>

<p>Another certain result of this condition of things is,
that the sharp pressure on the back edge of the stone
would almost certainly cause an appreciable indentation in
the cylinder covering. This would eventually cut through,
or at least interfere with the working of a larger sheet at
some future time.</p>

<p>The mechanism for raising or lowering the lithographic
stone in the machine for the adjustment of pressure is comparatively
simple (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_15" id="Fig_15"></a>
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="300" height="87" alt="Pressure Mechanism." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There are two screws similar to A which pass right
through the feet of the stone
carriage B B. A movement
of the screws will therefore
cause a corresponding movement
of the stone carriage
on the blocks or inclines C C. The lock-nut D holds the
screw securely once the pressure is adjusted.</p>

<p>So few printers really understand the proper adjustment
of a cylinder brake that some information concerning it will
no doubt prove acceptable. In the first place, a continuous
action brake which can be released at certain intervals is most
suitable. It holds the cylinders perfectly rigid whilst the
machine is running free, and applies a sufficient check at
the points required. The intermittent movement referred to
is obviated in various ways. <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a> shows an example of
one which is both simple and effective. It might be well
also to explain the principle and purpose of the cylinder
brake. It is almost impossible to cut mechanical gearing
which will run easily and yet be entirely free from <i>slogger</i>.
Consequently the revolution of a printing machine cylinder<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"><span class="pagenum">[39]</span></a>
would be more or less jerky unless steadied in some way.
This is especially the case when it reaches the stone, and,
owing to the pressure applied, lifts a little in the gearing.
A recognition of this simple matter will enable an intelligent
workman to arrange the brake action with judgment and effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_16a" id="Fig_16a"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16a.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A comparison of the old arrangement of inking rollers
(<a href="#Fig_16a">Fig. 16<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a>) with the new (<a href="#Fig_16b">Fig. 16<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a>) is in itself an object
lesson in this question of power and its economical application.
It is but reasonable to suppose that the power required
to move a set of rollers arranged in the old-fashioned
manner (<a href="#Fig_16a">Fig. 16<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a>) will be infinitely greater than that
which would be needed for such an arrangement as shown
in <a href="#Fig_16b">Fig. 16<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_16b" id="Fig_16b"></a>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16b.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Pursuing this matter still further, the question of indiscriminate
damping presents itself. Granted that the
influence here is an indirect one, yet it is a cause which<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></a>
frequently leads to an undesirable finish. Every printer
knows something of the effect produced by excess of water
upon printing inks. It hardens and stiffens them by
accelerating oxidisation. In course of time their free working
on the rollers is interfered with, and loss of power is by no
means the worst result. Weak and impoverished impressions,
abnormal wear and tear of the printing forme, and
excessive saturation of the paper may follow.</p>

<p>In lithography generally, and in lithographic machine
printing particularly, the damping of the stone is a matter
which requires constant and careful attention; any arrangements
for this purpose should therefore be as effective as
possible. The damping rollers should be thoroughly cleaned
each day, in order to remove any scum or grease which
may have been collected from the printing forme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_17" id="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="450" height="199" alt="Damping Rollers." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of damping rollers shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> is
a decidedly practical one. The upper roller consists of metal,
usually brass or zinc. It collects any accumulation of ink
or scum from the actual dampers, and can be cleaned at any
time without serious interference with the progress of the
work. Its adoption, however, has not been very general,
although it would be difficult to ascribe any good reasons
for such a fact.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Machine Printing</span>&mdash;<i>continued</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Register&mdash;Atmospheric Conditions&mdash;The Key&mdash;The Gripper&mdash;Starting
the Machine&mdash;Fixing the Stone&mdash;Strength of Colour&mdash;Grit&mdash;Making
Ready&mdash;Regulation of Speed.</div>

<p>It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance of
register in lithographic machine printing, and any suggestions
which are likely to be of assistance to the printer in this
matter will no doubt be welcomed.</p>

<p>Variable atmospheric conditions, insufficiently matured
paper, or constitutional defects in the machine, are frequent
sources of inaccurate register. These may be to some extent
unavoidable and therefore beyond the printer’s control, but
there are numerous other points which have an important
bearing upon the accurate fitting of one colour or forme with
another, and therefore require care and attention. The
following method of procedure is well worth consideration,
as it has decided advantages over many others.</p>

<p>The <i>key</i>, or outline forme, to which the colour formes have
been set up, is put into the machine at the beginning of the
printing operations. The exact position of the design on
the sheet is arranged, and twenty or thirty impressions taken
on a reliable paper. With these impressions as a guide it
is a comparatively easy matter to register each colour accurately.
This effects a saving both in time and material, and
rarely fails to produce satisfactory results. During the early
stages of the printing, when it is difficult to detect any<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></a>
slight movement of the stone in the machine, a sheet
bearing an impression of the key may be printed in the
usual way, when any variation in register will be revealed
at a glance. The relative positions of the side lay
and gripper seldom receive the consideration they ought to
have. The gripper and side lay should be exactly at right
angles to each other, and any divergence whatever from this
rule simply courts disaster. If they form an acute angle
there is a danger of the sheet moving <i>forward</i> a little as the
gripper closes. If, on the other hand, they are fixed at an
obtuse angle, there is a proportionate risk of the sheet
falling back as the gripper closes. If any degree of uniformity
could be guaranteed in these movements, then all would
still be well, but unfortunately no such guarantee can be
given, owing to a possible variation in the cutting of different
batches of paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_18" id="Fig_18"></a>
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="400" height="276" alt="Gripper." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Another matter of a similar character and quite as
important in its issues is more directly connected with the
gripper.</p>

<p>The type of gripper shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a> is probably the
best for general use. It enables the printer to use two or
more pins upon which to rest his sheet, according to the
particular requirements of his work. Two pins are usually<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></a>
sufficient and answer best, for the following reasons. It
is by no means unusual to find that the paper, trimmed
though it may be, has slightly convex or concave edges,
owing either to insufficient damping or an inaccurate setting
of the knife in the guillotine cutting machine. This can,
of course, be avoided, but the point at present under consideration
is one of <i>possible</i> effects. This contingency and
its effect are considerably exaggerated in <a href="#Fig_19">Figs. 19<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span> and
19<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a>, but for purposes of illustration the suggestiveness
of the two sketches is not at all too emphatic.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a name="Fig_19" id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="300" height="222" alt="Trimmed Edges." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Start the machine with a light pressure, for once the
stone is locked up a certain amount of danger will always
exist if at any time it
is necessary to reduce the
pressure. The stone may
still be held by the blocks,
even after the bed of the
machine has been lowered,
only to come down with
a snap when pressure is
applied. Such a danger
might, of course, be averted
by slackening the screws and blocks; but then the stone
would almost certainly move out of position and the registration
of the forme be altered.</p>

<p>Narrow slips of paper folded two or three times, and
inserted between the block and the stone, will often check
any tendency the latter may have to lift when the screws
are tightened.</p>

<p>Of the many annoyances associated with the lithographic
machine printer’s work, <i>grit</i> is probably the most troublesome,
inasmuch as its presence is almost imperceptible, while its
effect is extensive and often disastrous. Its sharp grains
become embedded in the inking-roller skins, and plough tiny<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></a>
furrows across the printing forme, doing much damage before
the printer realises the presence of any foreign matter on the
inking-rollers. Prevention is a simple matter enough, but a
cure is rarely, if ever, accomplished. Dust the rollers and
examine them carefully before commencing operations, and in
this way ensure perfect cleanliness. It may seem a trifle,
but it is none the less an important one, and perhaps the<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></a>
reader has already realised that “trifles make perfection,
and perfection is no trifle.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig_20a" id="Fig_20a"></a>

<p>In <i>making ready</i> on a lithographic printing machine, as
in almost every phase of industrial life, method is the great
secret of success. Method conquers the most stubborn difficulties,<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></a>
and, though it is not at all times profoundly interesting
in its application, yet it more than repays any monotony
it may involve. In the matter of lithographic printing, at
any rate, a few methods of an essentially simple character
might be cultivated with advantage. This chapter is not
intended as a complete record of such methods, but a number
of items are discussed <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'therein'">herein</ins> which, though simple, are
intensely practical, and likely to suggest more to the reader
than is found described in the text.</p>

<p>The question of speed may sometimes seriously handicap
progress. It is a self-evident fact that the solid impression
of a heavy poster cannot be made at the same speed as
a light tint in chromo work. Speed cones are usually fixed
to a counter-shaft to regulate the speed of the machine as
required. Figs. <a href="#Fig_20a">20<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a> and <a href="#Fig_20b">20<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a> show an improved arrangement
of this character, in which tapering drums A A are
substituted for cones, the belt being moved and held in any
position by the screw and forks B and C. D is the driving
pulley which transmits the power to the machine.</p>

<p>Electricity as a motive power for printing machinery is
quietly yet irresistibly winning its way into general favour,
and for very cogent reasons. It is the most convenient form
of motive power, and can be transmitted for long distances
without any appreciable loss. It takes up little space, and
almost entirely dispenses with belts and shafting. It is also
essentially economical, because it can be applied to the
smallest press just as easily as to a 60' by 40' poster
machine (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lithographic Colour Printing</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">A Commercial Value&mdash;Peculiar Features&mdash;Colour Sequence&mdash;Controlling
Elements&mdash;A Question of Register&mdash;Suitable Paper.</div>

<p>As a commercial phase of lithographic printing, colour
printing offers a vast and ever-widening field of usefulness.
Nor is it altogether deficient in these artistic qualities which
are pre-eminently suggestive, as well as attractive and artistic.
Colour printing, in its application to lithography, is in many
respects peculiar. It is not what might be described as a
self-contained process; for its successful realisation depends
as much upon the harmonious and skilful combination of
colours in the design as upon the manipulation of the printing
inks, the sequence of the colour formes, and their accurate fit
or register during the actual printing. The most excellent
printing would produce barely passable results unless the
design was effectively arranged, and prepared with some consideration
for the conditions under which it might be printed.
Nor is it at all unlikely that a design, however smart and
artistic it might appear in its original form, would be irretrievably
spoiled by clumsy handling or careless printing.
The subject for immediate consideration is the practical employment
of printing inks for the reproduction of coloured
designs, their qualities, peculiarities, and relative values, as
well as the means employed to make them amenable to
commercial conditions. An intelligent appreciation of these
points will not only extend the possibilities of printing inks,<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></a>
but will also enable the machineman to accentuate their
attractive and suggestive power.</p>

<p>“Colour is to design what salt is to food,” and successful
colour printing has been very aptly described as the adaptation
of printing ink to the ever-varying character of work
and conditions of employment. This very practical definition
will form the keynote of a chapter which, by the very
nature of things, must be to some extent authoritative and
comprehensive. The colour sequence, <i>i.e.</i> the order in which
the colours must be employed to secure the best and most
economical results, is of primary importance in colour printing.
On broad lines, the principle usually followed is one in
which the opaque colours are printed first, and upon these
all secondary effects are built up. This building up of
colours plays also a most important part. Its relation to
colour sequence is a necessary and influential one. For
example, it might not be absolutely essential that even a
yellow should be printed first, if it did not form the base for
the building up of a green by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'superposition'">super-position</ins> of blues, of
an orange effect in conjunction with red, or as a secondary
flesh tone under the buff.</p>

<p>The difference between printing a blue over a red or <i>vice
versâ</i> is also very striking. One produces a purplish-black
brown, and the other a rich chocolate-brown. Other complications
of a similar character are common, but these will
indicate with sufficient clearness the possible modifications of
colour sequence.</p>

<p>Another feature upon which colour sequence in printing
largely depends is the point at which the outline forme can
be most effectively introduced. It is advisable to print the
outline forme at as early a stage as possible for obvious
reasons. Perfect registration is far from easy to secure.
Red in the lips, blues in the eyes, and isolated touches of
colour in various parts of the design must fit the browns, and<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></a>
therefore fit each other, and yet they may have no direct
relation to each other in the printing. A remedy has been
already suggested, but once an outline forme is printed the
cause of bad registration is to some extent removed, and a
remedy quite unnecessary. When worked on reasonable
lines it is frequently an advantage to make the outline one of
the earlier printings, so that any harshness of contour, etc.,
may be toned down by the succeeding greys. It is often
a matter of personal opinion, or perhaps of circumstance,
which decides the final printings. The pink may be reserved
to impart brilliancy and warmth to the prints, or it may be
equally suitable to hold back a grey, and, by regulating its
tone and strength, soften down any tendency to hardness,
pick out the darker prints, and emphasise the shadows.
Even these suggestions, although usually regarded as standard
ideas, must be subjected to modifications under certain
conditions.</p>

<p>Here is a practical instance. Unless paper is unusually
well seasoned and of first-rate quality, the temperature of the
workroom equable, and the printing machine in good order&mdash;a
combination of excellences which is unfortunately rarely met
with&mdash;the colour sequence must be of a fairly elastic nature.
To print a gold first is quite usual, because the bronze powder
will persistently adhere to any preceding printings. From
that standpoint alone such a procedure would be eminently
practical and convenient, but suppose for a moment that the
gold must fit a later printing with absolute accuracy, <i>e.g.</i> an
outline forme, or as forming the base for some ornamental
scheme, then the difficulties which arise are somewhat trying,
and for this reason. The paper being new, the most serious
distortion of any kind is likely to occur during the first
printings, and so long as yellows, fleshes, or other colours of
a similar character are printed first, no serious difficulty
is likely to arise; but with the gold printing it may be<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></a>
altogether different. It is quite possible to make both
yellow and flesh dry dead, <i>i.e.</i> without even sufficient tack to
catch the almost impalpable bronze powder. At the same
time, care must be exercised that the colouring matter is not
left dry on the surface of the paper owing to its separation
from the reducing medium. This plan has been adopted
under actual commercial conditions and with conspicuous
success, and it is therefore offered as a preventive measure
which is free from many drawbacks which are the frequent
accompaniment of novel ideas and operations. Here then is a
simple practical summary of the idea. The yellow and flesh, or
equivalent colours, are printed first, so that they will dry free
from gloss or <i>tack</i>. The fit required between such colours
and subsequent printings is generally a matter of minor importance,
and at this stage distortion of the paper, whether
it be by stretching or contracting, will not seriously depreciate
the value of the print when completed. Register between
the gold and an outline is frequently of an entirely different
character, and in many cases the slightest variation will be
readily discernible, and have a decidedly bad effect on the
finished work. Apart from this, the questions which decide
or control the colour sequence have been clearly indicated
previously.</p>

<p>This matter may be one of convenience also, for unless
otherwise predetermined it would be unwise and far from
economical to print a blue before a yellow, or a black before a
red, etc. The amount of cleaning up thereby involved would
become a serious and distinctly disagreeable item, and purity
of tone in the lighter colours would be conspicuous by its
absence.</p>

<p>The matter of well seasoned printing paper has been
already referred to. For effective colour printing the paper
must also possess several other essential qualities. It should
be firm in substance, sufficiently absorbent to carry the<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></a>
successive layers of printing ink, as far as possible unstretchable,
and should present a smooth surface though not a
glazed one. The chalky, dull, enamelled papers offer many
recognised features of value to the colour printer. They
assist in the absorption of the ink as well as afford a suitable
surface for their impression. Friction-glazed and other
prepared papers are also excellent for colour printing by
lithographic methods.</p>

<p>For the successful manipulation of printing inks of any
description it will be necessary to know something of their
composition, or at any rate of such features as render them
peculiarly suitable for printing purposes. From a printer’s
point of view the most important of these features is what
may be described as the reducing medium, <i>i.e.</i> the medium
which holds together the various colours so as to produce
pigments of suitable working consistency. The most useful
and the commonest form of reducing medium is a linseed oil
product, known in its prepared state as a lithographic varnish,
with a supplementary title indicating its specific character.
Its value to the lithographic printer lies mainly in the fact
that when it is fully matured it possesses a good full body
along with fair drying properties and freedom from any
excess of greasy matter. This varnish is used in three or
four consistencies between which any degree of strength may
be arranged by mixing. A brief outline of the manner in
which they are prepared may still further emphasise their
usefulness in lithographic printing.</p>

<p>Raw linseed oil is matured and oxidised until its consistency
is considerably reduced. It is still further reduced
by being boiled at a high temperature, and is known commercially<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></a>
as “boiled linseed oil.” As this boiling is continued
the fumes which quickly rise can be ignited, and the liquid
soon assumes a syrupy or stringy character, according to the
length of time during which it is subjected to the action
of fire. By extending or discontinuing the burning the
varnish is produced in three grades&mdash;thin, medium, or
strong.</p>

<p>Lithographic varnish is a good servant but a bad master,
and it is a generally recognised fact that, beyond a certain
point, lithographic varnishes as a reducing medium will
depreciate the value of colour.</p>

<p>The chief requisite in colour printing is the production of
a solid flat impression, and for this purpose almost all printing
inks must be reduced to a suitable working consistency. To
accomplish this, and at the same time retain the full colour
strength of printing ink, a soft, free-working composition will
be useful and desirable.</p>

<p>There are several commercial varieties of solid oil from
which the excess of grease has been extracted. These
form excellent reducing mediums. They break down the <i>tack</i>
of stiff pigments and enable them to work freely during the
printing operations. The drying of inks thus prepared is not
seriously retarded; they <i>lift</i> readily and usually produce
brilliant impressions. There is a reasonable and logical
explanation of these peculiarities which is both interesting
and suggestive. Whatever the character of a reducing
medium may be, its effect on the strength of colour will
of course be in proportion to the quantity used. In all
probability 1 oz. of a solid oil composition, otherwise known as
lithographic reducing medium, would soften down a quantity
of printing ink for which at least three times its bulk of
varnish would be required. Consequently, the depth of
colour and covering power of an ink reduced with “litho
medium” would be proportionately greater than that reduced<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></a>
with varnish. Vaseline in some of its commercial forms is
frequently used by American printers, and even in this
country its use is being tardily, though none the less surely,
recognised.</p>

<p>A few remarks anent the <i>intelligent</i> application of a softening
medium may not be inopportune. Considerable care and
judgment must always be exercised or there will be a loss of
cohesion in the colour pigments which cannot fail to prove
disastrous. The tendency of lithographic varnish is to bind
the colour pigments together, and this should not be entirely
counteracted by the addition of fatty compositions, lest the
printing inks run “scummy” during printing operations,
and in drying leave the colouring matter, from which they
have been detached, on the surface of the paper in the form of
a dry powder.</p>

<p>Such lack of cohesion may, however, be an inherent
feature of the ink itself, and not be produced in the manner
just indicated. Bronze blue affords a striking example of a
printing ink of this character. It is, in fact, a “constitutional
weakness” which cannot apparently be prevented, but which
is fortunately not incurable. The addition of a little Canada
balsam to bronze-blue ink will add considerably to its
working qualities. The loose particles of the pigment appear
to be held together without becoming harsh or stringy, as
might easily happen if varnish of sufficient strength was
added to produce the same effect.</p>

<p>Other colours, again, such as vermilion and yellow, owing
to their weight and texture, will always require a fair
percentage of varnish in their composition. At the same
time, a little reducing medium might also prove beneficial.
Referring once more to the fact that vermilion, as distinguished
from its imitation, is unusually heavy, etc., it may be useful
to know that for “blocking out” work it has no equal in all
the range of printing inks. It possesses unrivalled opacity,<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></a>
and as a “blocking-out” agent frequently plays an important
part in colour printing.</p>

<p>Of the other printing inks, few possess characteristics of
a sufficiently striking character to require special mention.
Their working qualities present no exceptional difficulties, and
their employment either under primary or secondary conditions
is almost invariably determined either by the character
of the work or some such conditions as have been already
indicated.</p>

<p>When the strength of a colour is problematical, or its
effect more or less a question of experiment, it is a safe plan
to mix it a little lighter than will be required. For obvious
reasons it is much easier to alter the line or tone of a light
colour than that of a darker one.</p>

<p>The arrangements for extensive and economical ink
mixing need not be of a very elaborate character. Standard
colours might with advantage be mixed in large quantities
and kept as stock shades. Fleshes, pink, blues, greys, etc.,
are all useful colours which are in constant use. A warm or
cold tone could be imparted to a <i>stock</i> grey as required, and
a similar method adopted with regard to the other colours.
Other peculiar conditions could be met in a similar manner,
and many economies thereby effected.</p>

<p>Although the foregoing remarks refer mainly to lithographic
colour printing generally, they may with equal effect
be applied to many of its more specific branches.</p>

<p>Colour printing for tin-plate decoration will be fully discussed
in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Transfer printing for ceramic decoration presents many
features in common with transfer printing for metal decoration.
Printing colour transparencies is a commercial phase of
colour work which is productive of many curious and attractive
effects. Unlike the ordinary colour prints, the transparency
is intended for exhibition both by reflected and transmitted<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"><span class="pagenum">[56]</span></a>
light. The paper is of a thin, tough quality, and the first
printing is usually a white of good covering power and
exceptional opacity. It is not necessary to print a solid
white groundwork for the coloured design. If an intense
brilliant colour is required by transmitted light the omission
of part of the white printing will add considerably to the
effective character of the design. A brilliancy secured in
such a manner may be still further intensified by printing the
colour or colours in register <i>on both sides of the paper</i>. This
can be easily accomplished by first allowing the cylinder
covering to take an impression from the stone, and then, with
the sheet laid in the gripper, make a second impression in the
usual way immediately after.</p>

<p>The first print, which might be termed the transfer, will
then be made in accurate register on the back of the sheet.</p>

<p>Semi-transparent, or even transparent, effects can be
obtained with any of the colours by an omission of the white
printing from the parts affected. Complete opacity may be
secured by its introduction.</p>

<p>This print is afterwards rendered more or less transparent
by coating it with a suitable varnish.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Substitutes for Lithographic Stones</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Metal Plates&mdash;Preparation&mdash;Manipulation&mdash;Descriptive Details&mdash;Machine
Printing&mdash;The Printing Bed&mdash;Rotary Printing Machine.</div>

<p>Metal plate, as a substitute for stone, is now such an important
factor in lithography that the printer who wishes to
consider himself thoroughly efficient must possess a fairly
comprehensive and practical knowledge of its manipulation
and possibilities.</p>

<p>The prejudice which has hitherto checked the progress of
this branch of lithography was not altogether of an unreasonable
character. The plates themselves were far from reliable,
and the difficulties resulting therefrom were a fruitful source
of trouble and expense.</p>

<p>Metal, as a printing surface, is even yet a comparatively
new factor in lithography, and the majority of printers have
been working with lithographic stones from their apprenticeship
till the present time. It is not surprising, therefore,
that in relation to the use of stones almost every possible
contingency has been provided for, but with metal plates a
little fresh knowledge must necessarily be acquired before the
workman can claim the same familiarity of manipulation
which he may feel towards the parent process. This is, in
fact, the point upon which the whole question usually turns.
Good work can be produced from zinc and aluminium plates,&mdash;of
that there is not the slightest doubt,&mdash;and it is equally
certain that the advantages offered by their use are of a substantially<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></a>
practical character. They can be handled with
ease and with absolutely no fear of breaking. They are much
less costly than stone, and require less storage room.</p>

<p>A grain of a finer and sharper texture can be imparted to
metal than is the case with stone, and what is even of greater
importance, the character of such a grain remains unaffected
for a considerable time. Surface inequalities are rarely met
with in metal printing surfaces, and consequently uniform
pressure is to a certain extent guaranteed. In photo-lithography
it is possible to make a print from a negative direct
on to the plate (Chap. XVII. <a href="#Page_100">page 100</a>). This ensures an
original of exceptional clearness and strength, especially in
half-tone subjects.</p>

<p>Although an ordinary zinc plate, which has been carefully
polished to free it from every trace of grease, can be used for
lithographic printing, the best results are obtained from plates
which have been specially prepared. A slight de-polishing
with pumice sand and a piece of felt may impart the requisite
“tooth” to the face of the plate, or the following method may
be adopted:&mdash;Clean the plate with pumice sand and felt, and
immediately immerse it in a hot bath containing:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="lismall">
<li>18 oz. Water.</li>
<li>¼ oz. Alum.</li>
<li>1 dram Nitric acid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep this liquid in constant motion over the face of the
plate until it assumes an even, silvery-grey appearance, and
then wash it thoroughly with a plentiful supply of clean
water. Dry at once, and quickly.</p>

<p>These plates can also be sand-grained by specially constructed
machinery, or a variety of grains and stipple can
be imparted to their surface by etching or sand blast.</p>

<p>A novel yet practical idea, which has met with considerable
success, is to electrolytically prepare the surface of the
plates. The value of this preparation has been amply demonstrated<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></a>
by its extensive adoption and successful use. Another
distinctly progressive feature is a deposit of alumina on the
zinc, which for printing purposes gives it all the advantages
of an aluminium plate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig_a" id="Fig_a"></a>
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="400" height="459" alt="Plate-graining Machine." />
<span class="caption">Plate-graining machine, showing oscillating motion.</span>
</div>

<p>Transfers can be made on metal plates in much the
same manner as on lithographic stones. For press work
mount the plate on a piece of cardboard its own size, then,
having gummed a sheet of brown paper on the face of the
litho-stone, place the mounted plate near the centre and
fasten it with paste or gum. This will prevent it moving
about, and also raise it sufficiently from the stone to enable
the printer to use his damping-cloth and roller freely.<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></a>
Before mounting, the back of the plate should be carefully
dusted to free it from grit and dirt.</p>

<p>After the drawing or transfer has been made cover the
surface of the plate with strong gum, and while this is still
wet add to it a solution of bichromate of potash. Leave a
slight film only of the gum bichromate, and then dry it
quickly and thoroughly. Wash out the work with turpentine,
<i>not with water</i>. The gum, being insoluble in turpentine,
remains unaffected.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;"><a name="Fig_b" id="Fig_b"></a>
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" width="385" height="397" alt="Plate-graining Machine." />
<span class="caption">Plate-graining machine, showing interior of trough.</span>
</div>

<p>Roll the plate up <i>solid</i> in black ink, sponge it over with
water, damp it with a cloth, and then roll it up in the usual
way. When the work becomes fully charged with ink, dust
it over with a mixture of resin and French chalk, and etch
it with the acid etching solution.</p><p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></a></p>

<p>Every maker of zinc and aluminium plates supplies this
special etching solution, prepared for a certain quality and
character of metal. It is advisable, therefore, to use the
preparation recommended, and thus avoid the many pitfalls
which beset the path of the experimentalist.</p>

<p>“The plate is now well washed over with clean water, and
<i>thinly</i> gummed up. When the gum is dry wash out the
work on the top of the gum with dry flannel or felt till all
the work is removed, sprinkle a few drops of water on the
plate, and with a rubbing-up rag and a little ink and turps
rub up the work till it is gently charged with ink, then roll
up till work or transfer looks strong and sharp, when the
plate is ready for printing.”</p>

<p>For etching and rolling up chalk drawings on grained
plates: “Pour in a saucer some of the etching solution, and
add about the same quantity of fresh, strong gum. This
solution is evenly distributed all over the plate with a camel-hair
brush, and left to dry. Then the etching is removed
with water, and the plate very thinly gummed up and left to
dry. Now the work is washed out with turps and a piece
of dry, soft felt or flannel, <i>without water</i>, till all the work
disappears, and the plate rolled up solid black. Then sponge
over with water-sponge, damp over and roll up till work
appears nice and sharp. Now dust over with resin and
French chalk, and etch again with the etching solution, full
strength. After the etching has dried remove the same
with water, and gum up again.</p>

<p>“When drawings are to be washed out for proofing or
printing, the plate should first be thinly gummed up. This
gum layer is left <i>to dry thoroughly</i>, and is not removed
when the work is washed out (without water) with turps
and a dry piece of flannel or felt. Next wipe away all the
black ink and turps, still using no water for this operation.
Should any black work be left, use some more turps on<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></a>
the <i>clean dry rag</i> till all the work has been removed, then
sprinkle a few drops of water on the plate, and use a clean
rag to remove the gum layer and loose black ink left on the
plate, then damp over as usual and roll up.</p>

<p>“Plates treated in this way retain the grease contained in
the drawing, and the work rolls up easier and quicker, and
none of the finer work gets weakened or lost; also, the plate
keeps cleaner and free from scum.</p>

<p>“When alterations are necessary the work should be
rolled up with a strong black ink, and dusted over with
French chalk (powdered talc). Remove the part which
requires altering with a mixture of equal parts etching
solution and turpentine on a small piece of felt or flannel,
and rinse well with water. Pour some special re-preparing
solution in a saucer, and apply this solution with a camel-hair
brush to the parts where the work has been removed;
after the solution has remained for a few seconds rinse
well with water. This operation is to be repeated several
times till the surface looks clean, no work being visible;
and after the plate is dried with clean white blotting
paper it is ready to receive the additional work. When the
alteration has been made, the rolling up should be done with
the bichromate solution, as per general directions.</p>

<p>“Where the alterations involve additional work only
without erasures roll up the design first with a good,<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></a>
strong ink, and dust over with French chalk. The special
re-preparing solution is used in the same manner as acetic
or citric acid is employed on a litho-stone. For this purpose
we recommend that the special solution should be diluted
with an equal quantity of clean water, and the solution
applied with a camel-hair brush. It should remain on for a
few seconds, and then be quickly rinsed with clean water.
This operation may with advantage be repeated two or three
times for securing a clean surface for the additional work.
When the plate has been thoroughly dried with clean
blotting paper it is ready to receive the additional work.
The rolling up should be done with the bichromate solution,
as per general directions.”</p>

<p>Machine printing from zinc or aluminium plates requires
but a slight modification of well-known methods; and although
it may in some respects present entirely new features,
the making ready of work in which several printings are
employed is simplified, and consequently much time is saved.
In the ordinary type of litho-printing machine the printing
bed (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>) is levelled in the machine for the first printing,
and, if this is carefully arranged, no alteration will be required
throughout the whole series; for, in changing from
one colour to another, the printing plate can be slipped from
the bed and another substituted in a very few minutes. The
most scrupulous care should be exercised at all times to prevent
dirt or grit of any kind insinuating itself between the
surface of the printing bed and the back of the plate.</p>

<p>It is not in connection with the flat-bed printing machine,
however, that the most decided progress is likely to be made
in surface printing from metal plates. “The change which
is already foreshadowed in the printing mechanism of
to-day is shown by the growing demand for the rotary in
place of the slow and tedious movements of the flat-bed
press.”</p><p><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></a></p>

<p>The mechanical principle of the rotary machine (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>)
at once suggests an absolute precision of movement which it
is scarcely possible to guarantee in the flat-bed press. There
is no appreciable lift in the gearing of the cylinders when the
impression is made, and practically no risk whatever of
<i>slogger</i>, such as that described in Chap. VII. <a href="#Page_38">page 38</a>. The
uniform velocity of the cylinders, which is to a great extent
due to the points already indicated, considerably reduces
friction, produces perfect registration, and enables the machine
to be worked at a high rate of speed. The machine shown
on <a href="#Fig_23">page 63</a> presents many novel and essentially practical
features. The side elevation (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>) gives a fairly accurate
idea of its general mechanical principles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tin-plate Printing</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Its Evolution&mdash;Transfer and Direct Transfer Printing&mdash;The Coated
Paper&mdash;Reversed Designs&mdash;Sequence of Printing&mdash;Printing Inks&mdash;Purity
of Tone&mdash;Drying.</div>

<p>Tin-plate printing or decoration is probably the most remarkable
development of modern lithography. From a most
unpretentious and unpromising beginning its evolution has
been an unbroken record of phenomenal progress. Owing to
its intrinsic merits and peculiarly assertive character it has
created an enormous demand for its own productions.</p>

<p>Difficulties innumerable were encountered and surmounted,
whilst a whole host of trade prejudices had to be removed
before anything approaching a commercial success could be
claimed. The original idea was to transfer a printed design
from a suitably prepared paper to the metal plates in much
the same manner as the children of to-day use transfer prints
for decorative and other purposes. Though this method is
now to some extent superseded, it is by no means obsolete.
It is extensively used for certain classes of work, and so long
as the present type of direct tin-printing machine is used this
transfer method of metal decoration will more or less be
retained.</p>

<p>It is difficult, and in some cases impossible, to print
unusually large or exceptionally thick metal plates by the
direct process. Hence the value of Transfer Printing as a
useful auxiliary process which can be resorted to without<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></a>
the expense of special machinery. The ordinary lithographic
paper-printing machine, without any modification whatever,
will fulfil every requirement.</p>

<p>Almost any paper which has been coated with a starchy
composition will be suitable for Transfer Printing. Though
not absolutely essential, it is decidedly an advantage to use
a paper which is somewhat porous, not too hard. A brief
description of the principles involved will probably lead to a
clearer understanding of the points already indicated.</p>

<p>The print is made on the starchy composition with which
the paper is coated, and never actually penetrates to the
paper itself. This composition, being readily soluble in
water, can be transferred from its paper base to any other
surface, and will carry with it any print or impression
previously made thereupon. In theory, then, this process is
exceedingly simple, nor is it likely to present any insuperable
difficulties in practice.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of Transfer Printing,
which affects not only the colour sequence but the draughtsmanship,
is the inversion of the design when printed. To
the printer who is accustomed to chromo work on paper,
this matter will probably offer many awkward situations.
The control over colour effects is somewhat restricted, and
consequently not only care and skill, but a certain amount
of special training and actual experience, will be necessary
for the production of really successful work. In theory the
outline forme should be printed first, but in practice it is
frequently advantageous to introduce some of the transparent
tints as first printings. In the first place, such
prints rarely affect the design to any great extent as far as
register or fit is concerned. Consequently, any distortion of
the paper from atmospheric or other causes has no very
serious consequences, and such distortion, <i>i.e.</i> expansion or contraction,
would be most likely to occur during the initial<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></a>
printings. There is yet another and equally important
reason for this suggested modification of the colour sequence.
The light, tacky tints considerably improve the printing
surface offered by the mucilaginous coating of the paper,
and the stronger inks can be printed on it with a full body
of colour yet without any tendency to smash and smear. The
lighter tints, then, are printed first, and these are followed
by the opaque colours, reds and yellows being last. The
peculiar feature of such an arrangement is that, after the
first few printings, the design becomes partly obscured, and
the relative value of different colours, together with the effect
of their super-position, are frequently questions of skilful
calculation rather than visual appreciation. Thus successful
manipulation is therefore more or less the result of
careful observation and wide experience. In certain classes
of work it may, of course, be absolutely essential to ascertain
the effects of colours as they are printed. This can be done
by transferring a progressive print to a sheet of dull enamel
surface paper, using gum water as a transferring medium.
In all work where specific colour effects are required it will
be advisable to make such test transfers again and again at
different stages of the work.</p>

<p>Concerning the printing inks themselves but little need
be said. They must be of good quality, varnishable, and of
intense colouring power. Purity of tone is requisite, not
only under ordinary circumstances, but under what may be
regarded as exceptional conditions. The print, when subsequently
transferred to the metal plate, will be placed in a stove
having a temperature of 140° Fahr. Few colours remain
quite unaffected by this stoving, but with carefully selected
printing inks the effect is scarcely perceptible. It can,
moreover, usually be anticipated, and to some extent minimised,
either by judicious super-position or skilful preparation
of the colours themselves before printing. The following<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></a>
example will suggest a number of expedients for the preservation
of tone of colour in tin-plate decoration.</p>

<p>Pale blues will frequently become of a decidedly greenish
<i>hue</i> when varnished or stoved, and this may be modified by
an exaggerated intensity of colour, even to hardness, when
printing. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'At same time'">At the same time</ins>, it must be remembered that
“blues” are seldom, if ever, affected in <i>tone</i>. Pinks of the
lighter shades, on the other hand, may suffer both in <i>hue</i>
and <i>tone</i>. “Reds” may be mixed with a more liberal
amount of “lake” than they apparently need, and then
backed up with solid masses of “yellow” and “flesh.”
These will restore the bright vermilion hue, and likewise give
a greater amount of density or covering power to the colour.
Black, in the same manner, may be intensified by an underlay
of blue. As far as purity and density are concerned,
the “white” printing is by far the most important. The
primary function of this printing in tin-plate decoration is the
formation of an opaque ground on the metal plate&mdash;equivalent
to the white paper. Without it the colours of a design would
lose their brilliancy and effect, for their purity and density would
be affected by the lustrous sheen of the bright metal plate.</p>

<p>It is a printing, then, of some, importance, and the most
scrupulous care should be exercised during its manipulation.
In consequence of the exceptional density required it is
usual to repeat the “white” printing either two or three
times. The first printing especially should be made with a
smooth, well-mixed ink, which should be worked with the
intention of securing a perfectly flat and solid impression
rather than a heavy body of colour. The requisite amount
of density can be obtained by the second or third impressions.</p>

<p>A slight tinge of “Oriental blue” given to the “white”
will improve its appearance and counteract the discoloration
produced by the varnishing and stoving.</p>

<p>Another point with which the average printer is not<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></a>
familiar is the unusually rapid drying of each colour. The
printing inks must dry on the surface, and not even in the
slightest degree be allowed to permeate the paper. This is,
in fact, the <i>crux</i> of the whole matter; and, assuming that
the coating of the paper is suitable and perfect, the drying
cannot be otherwise than on the surface. Dryers, preferably
liquid, must be mixed with the printing inks in
liberal quantities. Here, again, experience alone can be
relied upon for guidance. Printing inks have their peculiar
characteristics, and atmospheric conditions are ever varying.
It would therefore be unwise to indicate any hard-and-fast
lines upon which to work. There is at least one danger
accompanying the use of dryers in any form which must
not be overlooked. Colours may dry too hard and present
for the succeeding printings a surface similar to a varnished
sheet, which will offer no <i>grip</i> to the printing ink, and upon
which it will probably run, and, consequently, produce a
defective impression. This is by no means an infrequent
occurrence. Experience alone can prevent it, but the
remedy is as simple as it is effective. Briskly rub each
printed sheet with a pad of soft rag and a little magnesia
or French chalk. Magnesia is best. It is an almost impalpable
powder, and has no ill effect even upon the most
delicate tints. This rubbing will produce a slightly matt
surface on the hard glossy ink, and on this a good solid
impression may be made without further trouble.</p>

<p>The printed sheets should be exposed to the air for a
few hours to accelerate drying. This may be done in any
convenient manner, either by laying them out in frames or
hanging them up. A “set off” in Transfer Printing should
be sedulously avoided; not that the soiling of the back of
a sheet is of any moment, but because the matter set off
on the back of one sheet must be pulled off the face of
another, and that very often in liberal proportions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Direct Tin Printing&mdash;The Machine&mdash;Peculiarities of Impression&mdash;Cylinder
Covering&mdash;Colour Sequence&mdash;Printing Inks&mdash;Drying
Racks&mdash;Air Drying and Stoving.</div>

<p>“Direct tin printing” is not, as the term might suggest, a
<i>direct</i> impression of the printing forme on the metal plate.
It is in reality a transfer printing process in which the
transferring medium is a cylinder with an elastic covering.
This additional cylinder is one of the chief characteristics of
a direct tin-printing machine, and, apart from a few accessory
movements, it is in this respect alone that it differs from an
ordinary lithographic printing machine. <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a> gives a
sufficiently clear idea of this distinguishing feature. A
detailed description of its mechanical principles is unnecessary,
but the following points will prove helpful.</p>

<p>The impression is made from the printing forme upon
the lower cylinder during the first half of its revolution, and
transferred to the metal plate, which is carried by the upper
cylinder as the revolution is completed. The reciprocal
movement of these two cylinders is therefore a matter which
demands the keenest possible attention. Their pitch must
be absolutely accurate, the pressure of one against the other
nicely adjusted, and the brake arrangement on both such as
to ensure a perfectly steady revolution.</p>

<p>The lower cylinder is covered with a three-ply rubber
blanket, which provides a sufficiently elastic impression surface.</p>

<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></a></p>

<p>This rubber covering is a most important feature, and
requires both careful adjustment and intelligent use. Careful
adjustment is requisite to ensure the tension being perfectly
uniform over the whole surface, when the material is drawn
taut by means of a tooth-and-ratchet arrangement. Were it
not so, the printing surface presented would naturally vary in
thickness and resilience, in consequence of which the pressure
would be variable and the impression distorted.</p>

<p>A most remarkable peculiarity of this rubber covering is
that it has a very decided influence upon the size of the
impression. If, for example, its pressure upon the printing
forme is increased, the impression will be slightly less
than the work on the stone, whilst a lighter pressure will
of course produce the opposite effect. It is advisable, therefore,
when making a first impression, to measure it from back
to front and compare it with the printing forme. This
method will ensure a print of the exact size, and avoid any
risk of complications in the subsequent printings. Such distortion&mdash;for
a distortion it really is&mdash;may frequently be turned
to good account, and under certain conditions it may prove to
be a help rather than a hindrance. Some slight inaccuracy
in the fitting of any part of the design may occasionally be
corrected by inserting patches of thin paper under the
cylinder covering, so as to almost imperceptibly increase the
pressure over the required area. This idea in its application
to “making ready” at a tin-printing machine will suggest
many possibilities to the resourceful printer, and if intelligently
treated will rarely prove troublesome. In a lesser degree the
same system of packing may be applied to the upper cylinder,
and the size of the impression to some extent controlled
during its transference to the metal plate. The speed of the
machine also affects the impression, and in a somewhat
peculiar manner. Several theories have been set forth to
prove why an increase in speed should produce a slight<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></a>
enlargement of the impression, and <i>vice versâ</i>; but it is
doubtful if any of them are altogether satisfactory. Most
probably it is due to a momentary change in the resilience of
the rubber. The character of the pressure, which is certainly
influenced by increasing or diminishing the speed, would of
course effect such a change. The effect, as just indicated, is,
however, only perceptible when a very pronounced variation
in the speed takes place. A rubber blanket is also affected in
a somewhat similar manner by atmospheric changes, though
not appreciably by moisture.</p>

<p>One other point in connection with the cylinder covering
is worth noting. Whenever it is necessary to remove the
impression from the blanket,&mdash;and the necessity may arise
many times during the course of a day’s run,&mdash;let it be
done with turpentine or benzole, and as rapidly as possible.
After the superfluous turpentine or other cleanser has been
wiped off, dust over the blanket with French chalk. This
will completely absorb any of the cleanser which may have
permeated the rubber, and thus minimise any injurious effect.</p>

<p>Unlike the Transfer Process in Direct Printing, the colour
sequence is practically the same as for paper printing.
There are, of course, essential points of difference, and these
may fitly mark the next stage of progress in the discussion of
this subject. In the first place, a bright metal plate does not
present an altogether suitable printing surface, and for several
reasons. The sheen of such a plate will show through many
of the printed colours with a dull metallic lustre. The
surface, again, is hard and excessively smooth, or, as it
is sometimes expressively described, without <i>tooth</i>. As can
easily be seen, this is far from an ideal printing surface.</p>

<p>White also plays a prominent and effective part in many
designs, and is frequently indispensable. Its presence,
when necessary in Direct Tin Printing, must therefore be
arranged for in some form or other. One white printing is<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></a>
seldom sufficient to produce a perfectly clean and solid
ground. Two printings, or even three, may be necessary.
Purity of tone is a most important point, and therefore
a pigment should be chosen which will not only remain
unchanged by its contact with the metal, but which will be
unaffected by the heat applied during stoving. The appearance
of this white may be improved by the addition of blue,
as in Transfer Printing (<a href="#Page_70">p. 70</a>), and here also the smallest
possible quantity will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Gold Lacquer Printing is peculiar to Tin-plate Decoration,
and its advent indicated a vast progress in artistic display
and effect.</p>

<p>Printing lacquer is a transparent pigment of about the
same consistency and character as printing ink. It is usually
prepared in three shades of colour&mdash;red, citron or orange,
and pale gold. A combination of these in suitable proportions
will produce almost any strength or shade of gold
which may be required. Except as regards their unusually
brilliant transparency, these lacquers much resemble yellow
lakes, and in paper printing might even be used as economical
substitutes for the more expensive pigments. This, however,
is only a suggestion, and has little if any practical bearing
upon their application to Tin-plate Printing, where they
completely transform the bright sheen of the highly polished
metal plate into a brilliant and most effective gold. Gold
lacquer is an exceptional pigment in many respects. It
works exceedingly well, and gives a sharp, flat impression
where most other pigments would fail. It also has the
power of conveying many of its own good qualities to any
printing ink with which it may be incorporated.</p>

<p>In Transfer Printing the question of rapid drying is very
important, and in Direct Tin Printing it is even more so.
Arrangements of a somewhat extensive character must be
made for the reception of metal plates immediately after<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></a>
printing, so that the air may freely circulate about them, and
thus assist in the drying. The room in which the printing
sheets are thus stored
must be free from dust,
for it will readily adhere
to the tacky printing
ink, and afterwards
prove a source of endless
trouble.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Drying racks of
various descriptions are
used for the storage of
printed metal plates.
One of the best is constructed
on the lines
shown in <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>. The
shelves A A are adjustable so as to carry plates of different
sizes. The printed sheets are set up on end in the grooves
B B, and by arranging
them back to back in
pairs a large number can
be accommodated without
hindering the drying.
Other types of drying
racks are shown in the
sectional drawings (Figs.
<a href="#Fig_27a">27<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span></a> and <a href="#Fig_27b">27<span class="smcap lowercase">B</span></a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The question of air-drying
<i>versus</i> stoving has
ever been a contentious
one, and admits of considerable
diversity of
opinion. Air-drying <i>is</i> preferable where convenient. It is
much more economical than stoving, of course; but, on the<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></a>
other hand, it might be a better plan to stove a printing than
to wait, perhaps for some hours, until it dried naturally. With
some printing inks and under certain
climatic conditions both may be necessary,
so it is almost impossible to lay down any
hard-and-fast rules as to the adoption of
either plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 222px;"><a name="Fig_27b" id="Fig_27b"></a>
<img src="images/i_094a.jpg" width="222" height="400" alt="Tin-plate Racks." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27b.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Some knowledge of their respective
disadvantage should be acquired, however,
in order to avoid, or at least minimise,
them.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, a course of eight
printings, each one absolutely necessary
to the design, and each one to be dried
by stoving. It is only reasonable to
suppose that the first and second printings
will be seriously affected by the subsequent stovings. They
will undoubtedly harden to such an extent as to render the
super-position of other colours a difficult matter, and their
purity of tone will most probably
be affected. According to the
same line of reasoning, some sheets
would be more affected by the heat
than others, owing to their position
in the racks, the heat of stoves
being greatest near the top.</p>

<p>Air-drying can only be accomplished
by adding to the printing
ink a proportion of some suitable
drier. (<i>See</i> Transfer Printing, <a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>.)
Naturally, it requires a much longer time, but it is equally
effective, much less troublesome, and generally more satisfactory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tin-plate Decoration</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Suitable Designs&mdash;A Variety of Effects&mdash;Gold Lacquer&mdash;Super-position
of Colours&mdash;Embossed Effects&mdash;Embossing Plates&mdash;Lacquers.</div>

<p>It is usually and rightly supposed that the most effective
results in Tin-plate Decoration are produced from designs
which are lithographed for that specific purpose.</p>

<p>Designs which are specially arranged for Paper Printing
can be used so long as the effect produced by the transposition
from right to left does not affect its application, or
render the same impossible. This, of course, applies more
particularly to designs in which lettering appears, but at the
same time it may affect designs of an essentially pictorial
character in an equally important manner; for it must be
remembered that a drawing for Tin-plate Printing must appear
on the lithographic stone exactly as it is impressed on the
metal, and not, as in Paper Printing, reversed from right to
left. This naturally simplifies the drawing on stone, and to
some extent enables the draughtsman to dispense with the
reversing mirror when copying.</p>

<p>The primary object of this short chapter will be to point
out some of the characteristic features of Tin-plate Decoration,
so that such methods as are usually adopted by the
artist and the printer may be modified or amplified to meet
any peculiar requirements of work in hand.</p>

<p>A greater variety of effects can be attained on the<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></a>
polished metal plate than it is at all possible to produce
on paper.</p>

<p>A gold effect, the result of lacquer printing, is especially
striking. In a similar manner an excellent translucent lustre
can be imparted to almost any colour by taking away the
white opaque ground, and thereby producing a peculiar semi-transparency
which is both pleasing and effective. Lacquer
printed over <i>white</i> produces a <i>buff</i> colour, which can be used
as a second yellow or to form the base of a flesh. The colour
of the lacquer is softer and less obtrusive when printed under
instead of above the white. The super-position of colour
generally, as described in Chap. XII. <a href="#Page_70">page 70</a>, is peculiar to
tin-plate printing, and suggests the advisability, if not the
necessity, of a special design. The advantages of such super-position
are obvious and substantial. Under ordinary commercial
conditions it is almost impossible in tin printing to
obtain the same intensity of tones in the printed colours as in
paper printing. Some such strengthener as the super-position
of suitable colours is therefore necessary. The work of the
lithographic draughtsman is in this respect of a somewhat
unusual character; but a little intelligent consideration will
render its execution on these lines comparatively easy and
satisfactory.</p>

<p>As already stated, yellows can be accentuated by a
super-position of lacquer, and in the same manner blues and
greys add intensity to black. Red can be strengthened by a
foundation of lacquer, also flesh and yellow, either singly or
in combination. The drawing of lacquer and white formes
should receive the most careful attention. They should fit
each other accurately, even to the most minute details; for
the slightest overlapping will be revealed by the presence of
a very assertive buff colour, while any deficiency in combination
will leave a not less striking margin of bright tin
exposed.</p><p><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></a></p>

<p>In some instances it might be an advantage to transfer
one forme from <i>black</i> to <i>white</i> to produce the opposite colour,
and thus ensure perfect register.</p>

<p>In decorative designs particularly, tin-plate printing
suggests almost unlimited possibilities for brilliant effects,
and in this respect it offers fair latitude for individual originality
and manipulative skill. In the production of show
tablets especially, considerable attention has been given to
embossing, in order to suggest and represent relief. Though
not actually produced by the artist, this is in effect part of
the scheme or plan of his design, and will consequently influence
his work to some extent. For simple ornamentation
only, metal embossing presents little that is new or novel;
but for the production of relief effects in the pictorial
elements of a design its application becomes a more important
and influential matter. By its aid a flat and otherwise
uninteresting subject can be made attractive and vigorous,
and for general purposes of effective display its value will be
considerably enhanced and its assertive character emphasised.</p>

<p>Without entering too minutely into matters which affect
the lithographic printer in an indirect fashion only, it will
yet be useful to him to know how an embossing die is
produced which registers accurately with the design to be
operated on. A black impression of the outline forme of the
design is made on transfer paper similar to that described
in Chap. XII. <a href="#Page_68">page 68</a>, and re-transferred, by pressure only, to
another sheet of the same paper. The re-transfer is to be
the impression required, and this in its turn is re-transferred
again to a prepared brass plate. The only preparation
necessary is the levelling and planing of the plate, and, if
desired, it can be coated with a thin layer of white paint
or enamel. This white ground makes the work easier, by
rendering the impression more distinct. With such a guide as
this the cutting or engraving is a comparatively simple matter.</p><p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></a></p>

<p>The engraved plate is placed in a casting box, and a
stereo-metal casting is made from it. A little trimming may
be necessary for the completion of these two tools, and they
will require to be suitably mounted, so that they may be
accurately adjusted in the embossing press.</p>

<p>Metal embossing has certain limitations which must be
recognised as an essential condition of its effective application.</p>

<p>The plates vary considerably in texture and temper,
and the depth and character of relief will, to some extent
at least, be controlled by the quality of the metal. Sharp
lines and abrupt terminations impose a strain under which
many plates split, therefore such features ought to be
avoided. Easy, rounded lines, rather than those of the
straight furrow description, produce the best results and give
least trouble during operations. Where abrupt terminations
are quite unavoidable the design should, if possible, be so
arranged as to evade the super-position of colour over these
parts.</p>

<p>Lacquer, if properly mixed and applied, is probably the
toughest pigment used by the tin printer, and is generally
suitable for embossed work. It prints an exceedingly thin
layer or film on the face of the metal, which under average
conditions rarely interferes with the working of the embossing
tool.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Photo-Lithography</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Early Experiments&mdash;An Analysis&mdash;The Direct Process&mdash;Transfer Process&mdash;Line
and Half-tone&mdash;Some Difficulties&mdash;A Natural Grain&mdash;Ink Photo-screen
Effects&mdash;Essential Features.</div>

<p>One of the most promising features of lithography is its
co-partnership with photography as a rapid and accurate
method of reproduction. The resources offered by this combination
are very extensive. For facsimile copying and
proportionate enlargement or reduction photography stands
unrivalled, and, although in certain phases it may be
somewhat mechanical in its effects, its relation to lithography
as a reproductive art is nevertheless of an intensely
practical nature, and far from inartistic in character.</p>

<p>The first idea of inking up a photographic print so that
it might be transferred to the lithographic stone was suggested
in the simplest possible manner. A brief account of its
inception will be instructive as well as interesting, inasmuch
as it will lead to a clearer conception of the elementary
principles involved.</p>

<p>During the early experiments in carbon printing it was
discovered that a gelatinous film sensitised with certain
bichromates could be charged with a coloured pigment, and a
picture developed thereon. At first it was not realised that
images produced by the action of the light on such a surface
could be inked up with a greasy composition and afterwards
transferred to the lithographic stone, but it was not long<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></a>
before this important point became apparent. It was found
that after exposure under the negative the transfer ink would
only adhere to such portions of the gelatinous surface as had
been acted upon by the light.</p>

<p>Photo-lithography will best be considered under two
sections, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <i>direct</i> process, in which the actual printing surface
is prepared and exposed under the negative.</p>

<p>2. The <i>transfer</i> process, in which a gelatine-coated paper
is sensitised in a solution of bichromate of potassium and the
photographic print made upon it.</p>

<p>The <i>direct</i> process in its application to the lithographic
stone is uncertain in its results. It is impossible to secure
sufficiently close contact between the negative and the stone,
particularly when large surfaces are under operation, and
consequently the print is rarely if ever an unqualified success.
The erasure of defective work is also a serious matter, and can
only be effected by polishing and preparing the stone again.</p>

<p>In the <i>transfer</i> process absolutely close contact can be
assured by the use of the transfer paper; and should the
print from any cause whatever prove defective, another can be
made immediately without any serious loss of time or material.</p>

<p>The successful application of the <i>direct</i> process to zinc and
aluminium plates is, however, an accomplished fact. The metal
plate is sufficiently elastic to adapt itself to any inequalities
on the surface of the negative. Under such conditions as
these this process offers at least one very important advantage.
There is not the slightest possibility of distortion such as
might occur in the development of a transfer. The metal
plate also lends itself to easy manipulation.</p>

<p><i>Photo-lithography</i> in <i>line</i> is simply the reproduction of
line drawings or prints in which the design is represented
in black and white with only such gradations as may be
suggested by lines or dots.</p><p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></a></p>

<p><i>Half-tone</i> photo-lithography is the reproduction of a
design or copy which has in its composition gradations of
tone in the form of flat tints.</p>

<p>It is sometimes described as the translation of the
graduated light and shade of the original copy into a surface
which can be printed from by mechanical means, for which
purpose the ink-bearing surface is broken up into the most
minute sections, and thus forming an almost imperceptible grain.
The first attempts to reproduce the half-tones of a copy, in
the form of a grain consisting of minute dots of varying size
and contiguity according to the gradation of tone required,
were made with a screen of open textile fabric. This screen
was placed between the lens and the sensitive plate, but the
results were crude and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The invention of cross-lined screens, in which the lines
were cut on glass and filled with black or other suitable
colouring matter, was a decided advancement in the half-tone
photo processes.</p>

<p>The “screeny” effect produced by the “unvarying uniformity
of grain” in half-tone work is undoubtedly the chief
drawback to its more extensive adoption for photo-lithography.
Fine etching cannot be resorted to as in photo-engraving,
neither is it possible, to emphasise effects by skilful overlay
and underlay; consequently half-tone impressions from a
lithographic stone are frequently disappointing. There are
no insurmountable obstacles to hinder the production of
excellent transfers, nor is it a difficult matter to transfer
them to stone. The trouble is, as already pointed out, the
unvarying uniformity of the grain.</p>

<p>This effect, or rather this lack of effect, has been to some
extent overcome by the use of a “four-line” screen in lieu of
the usual “crossed” screen, but even this is merely a <i>remedy</i>
and not a <i>cure</i>.</p>

<p>It has been confidently asserted that the highest degree<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></a>
of excellence in photo-process work will be attained by the
adoption of what may be termed a natural grain. Several
processes have been introduced which are undoubtedly based
upon collotype methods in which a reticulated grain is
produced more or less suitable for lithographic printing.
Unlike the mechanical screen grain the texture of these
processes reproduces the original copy with but little, if
any, loss of expressive power. This is indeed a feature
of considerable importance, and suggests many possibilities
in the way of artistic reproduction.</p>

<p>To reproduce an old chalk drawing so that it might
be successfully transferred to stone and printed in the
usual way, would be practically impossible by any other
process. In copying through a ruled screen many of the
delicate contrasts of light and shade would be so reduced
as to become almost valueless, consequently the print loses
both in artistic and expressive power. In contradistinction
to this a natural grain exhibits no harshness or indistinctness
in the gradations of tone, and retains its clearness and sharpness
throughout the printing operation.</p>

<p>Reverting again to the half-tone ruled screens, it may be
well to state that small prints, being usually subjected to a
closer inspection than large ones, must be reproduced with great
attention to the finer details to ensure a certain amount of
fidelity, and for this reason a screen with fine rulings must
be employed. Naturally, stronger and more vigorous reproduction
can be secured with the coarser rulings, but the <i>screen</i>
effect will be too pronounced for close scrutiny.</p>

<p>There is still much to achieve in photo-lithography, and
it is probably owing to a full recognition of this fact that the
progressive character of the process is maintained. Its commercial
value is undoubted, and its successful application is
chiefly a question of <i>how</i> and <i>where</i> it can be most effectively
introduced.</p><p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></a></p>

<p>The essential features of photo-lithography are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A copy or original in which the modelling is well
defined, and the light and shade well emphasised, even to a
point of slight exaggeration.</p>

<p>2. A <i>negative</i> in which the whites of the original appear
opaque, with clear glass to represent the lines and solids.</p>

<p>3. A <i>print</i> which can be developed or inked up with a
pigment sufficiently greasy in nature to transfer to the lithographic
stone.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that well-defined modelling is
most desirable in the original copy. To secure this a considerable
degree of artistic perception and discretion, as well
as manipulative skill, is requisite. In photo-process work
it is almost impossible to produce artistic effects from an
indifferent or unsuitable copy.</p>

<p>Pen-and-ink sketches and wash drawings are entirely
under the control of the artist, and characteristic effects
are chiefly due to bold and vigorous conception and skilful
drawing. Few photographs are suitable for photo-mechanical
reproduction without some previous preparation. Accentuation
or modulation of the high lights and shadows will in
all probability be necessary to secure a sufficient contrast of
light and shade. The middle tints may require but little
attention, unless it be to work down any tendency to abruptness
in the gradations of tone. A bold and well-defined
silver print usually copies well when clamped between two
pieces of glass to take out the grain, and photographed by
artificial light.</p>

<p>Scraper boards offer most remarkable possibilities for
black and white and half-tone sketches. A careful examination
of <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a> will serve to demonstrate their peculiar fitness
for process drawing. A light wood pulp board forms a convenient<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></a>
base upon which a thick coating of white composition
is laid. Black ruled lines are printed on this surface, and
lines of a similar texture are embossed at right angles to
them. Some of the characteristic effects which can be produced
on this board by the use of the crayon and scraper are
suggested by Nos. 6 and 7, <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. No. 8 gives a stipple
which is both printed and embossed. No. 9 is a plain board
upon which pen-and-scraper effects alone are produced.
Drawings in pen and ink, on Nos. 10 and 11 patterns, may
be effectively handled by a free and skilful use of the scraper.
Embossed lines only are the peculiar features of these boards,
but variety of texture can be obtained by scraping these lines
into dots.</p>

<p>Scraper board sketches almost invariably represent a
maximum of effect with a minimum of work, and for this
reason alone such an adaptable and simple medium should
soon win its way into general favour.</p>

<p>Their merit, however, is not confined to this one point.
They provide almost unrivalled copy for photo reproduction,
and can therefore be applied to a variety of purposes. Even
a cursory glance at the scraper board sketch on <a href="#Page_91">page 91</a> will
reveal many points of interest and value which a more careful
scrutiny can scarcely fail to emphasise.</p>

<p>Small patches of scraper boards can be introduced into
process drawings of any description, and brilliant results be
secured thereby. In such a manner clouds, waves, foliage,
and a variety of other effects can be introduced.</p>

<p>Shading mediums are already well known to lithographers,
yet it is doubtful if their usefulness for the amplification
of sketches or process drawings is fully appreciated. They
offer almost endless combinations of texture and tint, and are
therefore most useful and valuable accessories in the hands of
a resourceful artist.</p>

<p>Many artists favour crayon work on a grained paper, adopting<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></a>
a broad sketchy treatment in liberal proportions, so that in
the subsequent reduction the freedom of the original will be
toned down just sufficiently to enhance the picturesque and
artistic value. Drawings made on scraper boards, grained
papers, or by the aid of shading mediums, are photographed
and reproduced by the ordinary line method. In
making sketches for “half-tone” photo-mechanical reproduction
it must be remembered that, as far as photo-lithography
is concerned, it is impossible to accentuate effects by what is
known as “fine etching” when applied to photo-engraving.
A negative for photo-process work of any description should
be absolutely perfect in every respect. The whites of the
copy in the negative should be of an absolutely opaque black,
showing clean, sharp edges, with clear glass representing the
lines, dots, etc. These are all-important factors, and their
influence upon the reproduction of the original can scarcely
be over-estimated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">A Copying Table&mdash;Exposure&mdash;Illumination&mdash;Photo-litho Transfers&mdash;The
Paper&mdash;Printing&mdash;Developing&mdash;A Direct Process.</div>

<p>To discuss the respective merits of the “wet” collodion,
collodion emulsion, and dry-plate processes lies beyond the
province of this work, as does also a detailed description of
the operations involved.</p>

<p>The processes are purely photographic, and have already
been presented to the craft in various forms. It is, moreover,
almost impossible to bring within the limits of a single
chapter anything approaching to a comprehensive record of
the multitudinous details upon which process photography is
based. All that can be attempted is to take one or two outstanding
features which suggest a few useful hints.</p>

<p>The original or copy for reproduction must be on the
same optical plane as the sensitive plate in the camera, <i>i.e.</i>
they must be absolutely parallel with each other. There
are several ways of ensuring this. The most convenient
method is to use a copying table and board similar to <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>.
With such an arrangement as this direct copying can be
attained through the lens, or the camera can be turned half-way
round, and the image reversed by means of a mirror
or prism attachment. The chief advantage of such an
arrangement is, that the position of the camera can be
altered at will without affecting the relative positions of the
plate and copy.</p>

<p><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"><span class="pagenum">[99]</span></a></p>

<p>Correct exposure and sufficient illumination of the
copy are important factors in photographic reproductions of
any kind, but they are of infinitely greater importance when
applied to photo-process reproduction. One is, to a certain
extent, dependent upon the other. The former must of
necessity be controlled by the latter; yet no amount of
exposure will compensate for defective illumination. Where
artificial light is employed the advantage of using two lights
is obviously great. Apart from the greater brilliancy and
intensity of the light, the illumination of the copy is more
evenly distributed. In scraper-board copies no shadows are
thrown from the embossed dots or lines, and the granular
texture of grained papers is almost entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>A bichromated, gelatine paper can be obtained by coating
a hard writing paper of medium thickness with a gelatinous
solution consisting of 1 oz. of gelatine and 1 oz. of water,
and afterwards sensitising it with bichromate of potassium.
It is advisable, however, to use the commercial varieties of
coated paper, and to sensitise it as it is required.</p>

<p>The sensitising solution can be prepared by dissolving
1 oz. of bichromate of potassium in 20 fluid oz. of water.
Add to this sufficient ammonia to give it a bright orange
tinge. Keep this solution at a temperature of 60° Fahr.,
and float the paper on it for about one minute. Pin or
clip the paper to a board or squeeze it to glass, and dry in
a dark room.</p>

<p>Print this paper under the negative in a diffused light
until the design appears in a rich golden-brown colour,
when the exposure may be regarded as sufficient. The time
allowed for such an exposure will, of course, vary according
to the quality of the negative and the intensity of the light.</p>

<p>A development of the print may now be proceeded with
in the following manner.</p>

<p>Thin down a little transfer ink with turpentine and<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></a>
distribute it evenly on a composition roller. Roll up the
print until it is completely covered with an exceedingly
fine film of ink, after which allow the turpentine to
evaporate. Immerse the transfer in tepid water for about
10 minutes, and then rub it gently with a piece of cotton
lint previously soaked in water, until the superfluous ink is
removed and the design stands out clean and sharp.</p>

<p>The transference of the print to stone can be accomplished
in the usual lithographic manner. The chief points
to be observed are, to allow sufficient time for printing, and
to ink up the transfer with the thinnest possible film of ink.</p>

<p>A photo print can be made direct on the zinc or
aluminium plate, and by a slight modification of the photo-engraving
process it can be developed according to lithographic
methods.</p>

<p>It is impossible to introduce an intermediate process
without, in some manner at least, depreciating the quality of
the work. In a direct photo print on zinc, or, in fact, on any
suitable printing surface, the finer qualities of the work are
much more likely to be retained than when a transfer print
is made under the negative and afterwards transferred in
the usual manner.</p>

<p>Coat a finely grained zinc plate with sensitised asphalt
solution and expose it under a negative for about 4½ minutes
in direct sunlight, and from 12 to 15 minutes in a diffused
light. The action of light on the asphalt solution is to
render it insoluble in turpentine, so that if a sufficiently
exposed plate is immersed in pure turpentine the lines, etc.,
of the design, being of course represented by clear lines
in the negative, will remain intact, while the surrounding
portions will be dissolved and washed away. After development
wash the plate freely in water, and dry it by fanning
or with a pair of bellows. Let it stand for about 10 minutes
and then slightly etch it with a very weak solution of nitric<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></a>
acid. Cover the work with strong, fresh gum, and dry it
thoroughly and quickly. Remove the gum and “rub up”
the design with black ink in the usual way. Wash, dry,
and dust over with French chalk. The plate can then be
prepared in the manner described in Chap. XI. <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
